24,ICICI Bank,05-Nov-20,"Good time to build a portfolio, brokerages pick 20 stocks for 13-49% return",1,"Recent data suggests that the economy is on the path to recovery. The September quarter earnings along with management commentaries also seem to point to that as the government continues its efforts to revive demand.The equity benchmarks have been marching towards the record highs seen in January 2020. The BSE Sensex reclaimed 41,000-mark on November 5 and the Nifty50 hit 12,100, though some part of the rally is fuelled by by US elections.Both indices have gained around 60 percent from the lows of March 23, with midcap and smallcap mirroring the performance.""Overall we remain cautiously optimistic – cautious due to valuations and growth uncertainty for India, optimistic because there are some visible signs that consumption is reviving. Expanding central bank balance sheets and strong inflows into equity markets have kept the markets buoyant over the last six months, any reversal, on this may impact the overall bullish sentiment,"" Mihir Vora, Director & Chief Investment Officer at Max Life Insurance told Moneycontrol.He said the overall themes remained the same—consumption revival, exporters and Make-in-India plays.Axis Securities, too, is confident about digital, pharmaceuticals, private banks, telecom, staples, personal transportation and rural themes and also sees potential in housing in 2021.""Even as uncertainty could continue post US elections, fiscal stimulus likelihood will rise and the dollar could weaken, which will benefit the emerging markets. 2021 is likely to be a good year for the emerging markets as inflows are likely,"" the brokerage said.Given the outperformance of midcaps and smallcaps over largecaps, especially after the September quarter earnings, analysts say this is the right time to build a portfolio.Here is the list of 20 stocks that can return 13-49 percent:Brokerage: Axis SecuritiesICICI BankICICI Bank is well placed with stable NIM, low cost of funds and healthy capital adequacy. The recent capital raise has improved Tier I to 17.9 percent, which provides adequate balance sheet buffer. We believe valuations are undemanding for the stock, given the strong liability franchise and leveraging opportunities across group products. We remain positive on the stock and maintain buy with SOTP of Rs 504.Manappuram FinanceWe believe that credit costs will remain high on asset quality concerns for the non-old business. We expect cost optimisation to aid profitability. Balance sheet liquidity remains comfortable with no funding challenges. While cautious on the non-gold business, we believe gold business will support overall performance in uncertain macro conditions. We expect MGFL to maintain ROAE of around 24 percent over FY21/FY22. Gold lending is a high moat business and specialists like MGFL will continue to benefit.Can Fin HomesWhile loan growth moderation is expected along with slight asset quality deterioration on account of Covid-19, we expect the company to recover faster than its peers due to its loan mix and negligible developer exposure. Lower cost of funds should aid the company in maintaining NIMs while the loan mix profile skewed towards salaried segment will help in maintaining asset quality. We expect lower provisions and improved NIM for FY21E. We remain positive on the stock, given its loan book profile, stable liquidity position and robust CAR (25 percent) and recommend ""buy"" with a target price of Rs 515.NOCILWe expect NOCIL to register revenue/earnings CAGR of 20/24 percent respectively over FY20-23E. This growth will be driven by 1) utilisation ramp-up at Dahej; 2) relatively high entry barriers and long customer approval cycles, 3) debt-free status maintained even in challenging times and 4) likely ADD levy to support margins in the medium term. At CMP, the stock trades at an attractive 9.6x FY23 EPS, leaving enough room for an upside.Varun BeveragesWe expect VBL to register revenues/earnings CAGR of 11/29 percent, respectively, over CY19-22E. This growth will be driven by 1) consolidation in newly acquired territories, 2) distribution led market share gains, 3) cost efficiencies and margin tailwinds (cost rationalization and benign RM) should support EBITDA margin in CY20E despite weak operating leverage.CCL ProductsWe believe CCLP is well placed to deliver steady earnings over the medium term given 1) expertise in customised blends & cost-efficient business model, 2) long-standing client relationships (around 50 percent revenue contribution from brand owners) 3) largest exporter of instant coffee in India 4) presence in Vietnam, world’s largest Robusta growing country 5) capacity additions in value-added products (FDC & small packs) and 6) steadily improving branded retail business.Endurance TechnologiesWe expect Endurance Technologies to outperform the industry, given its sticky relations with OEMs, broad product basket, market leadership with market share of around 35 percent in suspensions, 25 percent in hydraulic braking system, 20 percent in disc braking system and 16 percent in transmission. New products along with tailwinds for the two-wheeler sector will support Endurance Technologies.Steel Strips WheelsBeing in an oligopoly market, SSWL commands leadership with a market share of around 55 percent in steel wheel rims and around 20 percent in alloy wheels. We expect SSWL to outperform the industry given its sticky relations with OEMs across all auto segments—2/3W, PV, CV, and tractors.Minda IndustriesWe are bullish on MNDA’s ability to comprehensively beat industry performance by 1) leveraging the broader vehicular trends of industry like EV, premiumisation, automation 2) strategic inorganic acquisition to enhance product offering and gain market share 3) maintaining balance sheet discipline and maintain optimal leverage, 4) investing In R&D to bring technological change 5) tap its deep-rooted relationship with OEMs to increase kit value. Given its success in developing import substitution products, it would be able to capture the business opportunities offered by the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ move in the auto sector. New product lines to aid margin and growth.Dr Reddy's LabsDRRD has leveraged its 100 ANDAs portfolio and launched high-value products with limited competition in the last two years. Further, commentary from the top six generic pharma players in NAG reveals pricing stability in the business. In the next two years, DRRD has a healthy pipeline to launch drugs like gRemodulin, gDexilant, gNuvaring, gCopaxone and gKuvan and potentially gVascepa that could be a gSuboxone kind opportunity. We expect revenue CAGR of 8.7 percent in constant currency for North America generic business over FY20-FY23.BioconDriven by market share gains and new launches in these high-margin biosimilars, the biologics segment is expected to post robust revenue growth (approximately in mid-twenties) over the next two-three years. Biocon management has set an ambitious target to cross $1 billion revenues for biologics over the next couple of years (from around $300 plus million in FY20). Biocon is targeting eight different biosimilars to be sold by FY22, thereby addressing a market size of $33 billion.

Profit growth will be even more significant considering FY20 was a loss for the company.HCL TechnologiesHCL Tech reported better than expected Q2FY21 numbers on both the margin and revenue front. Strong revenue growth in Mode 2 business (15 percent YoY) helps HCL Tech to achieve higher growth momentum in the longer term with more advance technologies.Better business matrix will help to generate higher operating business even if there is pricing pressure across verticals. We believe better business matrix and large long-term contracts make HCL Tech a promising investment as compared to its Indian peers. We believe HCLT has a resilient business structure from a long term perspective.Hindustan UnileverHindustan Unilever (HUL) delivered decent numbers for Q2FY21, both on the volume and profitability front amid headwinds on margins slump in discretionary consumption. We believe, H2FY21 will see the recovery across segments and HUL will capture decent market share backed by an increase in advertising and promotion expenses and its focus on innovation and market development (launched 100+ new SKUs in the last six months) compared to its peers.ITCITC with diversified operations across non-cyclical sectors, a resilient business model, strong-brand leadership position in cigarette business, product innovation track record & premiumisation drive is establishing itself as a FMCG major. Despite the ongoing COVID-19-related slowdown, we see recovery signs in recent months and the current valuation attractive. Besides, we expect the cigarette business to revive in the future with strict regulation from government on curbing the sale of illegal cigarettes.CiplaRespiratory drugs has seen traction in demand owing to COVID-19 and market leader like Cipla is eyeing greater attention from the investment community. The company was able to garner 65 percent market share (Q1FY21) in Proventil market with its newly launched Albuterol Sulfate.

The mid-sized IT firm won several large deals across technology, BFSI and medical devices verticals, providing good medium-term visibility. Wage hikes will be awarded in Q3FY21, which will be offset by revenue growth and offshore shift of large deals. There remains good scope for cross-selling services between Alliances and TSU.

Or, help us over a period of time in making a transition to a greener facility,"" Tata Steel CEO and Managing Director TV Narendran said in response to a Moneycontrol query, during a media briefing on November 17.Narendran added that while the company has already got financial assistance from the UK government, this was more immediate in nature to help the company's present cash flow. The support is something that the government is giving to all companies, to tide over the impact of COVID-19.The top executive however declined to quantify the support. He added: ""That is not enough to make the business going in the long term.""The UK unit of Tata Steel's European operations is under focus as the company has now engaged with Sweden's SSAB to sell the Dutch arm. On November 13, Tata Steel made official its talks with SSAB and said that it may take about six months to complete the process.Both the UK and Dutch operations till now came under Tata Steel Europe. But now the two will be separated and the bigger and more profitable Dutch unit will be taken over by SSAB.The Netherlands operations contribute about 70 percent of Tata Steel Europe business, and there have been concerns about the UK unit - which has struggled most historically - managing by itself.The European operations come from Tata Steel's acquisition of Corus in 2006, a $13 billion-deal that the company has struggled to manage since then.At the same time, the potential deal with SSAB will help the company partly or completely clear the debt of Euros 1.7 billion that Tata Steel Europe has. While the company has till now been mum on the deal value, industry observers put it at multi-billion dollars.But will a standalone UK operations put a drain on its Indian parent?Narendran doesn't think so.""Last six months, Tata Steel Europe has been cash positive and neutral and hasn't got support from India. The UK operations are within sight of meeting the target of being self-sustainable,"" he said.""The mandate,"" Narendran added, ""is to run without India's support.""It will give confidence that the European market has recovered well, with demand for steel picking up, especially from the auto industry.

49,Tata Steel,13-Nov-20,Tata Steel confirms talks with Sweden's SSAB to sell Dutch unit,1,"Tata Steel has confirmed that it's in talks with Sweden's SSAB to sell its unit in the Netherlands, the flagship of its operations in Europe.This is a fresh attempt from India's largest steelmaker to find a solution to its troubles in Europe, more than a year after a merger with Germany's thyssenkrupp was blocked by European Commission.The company said it has ""commenced discussions with the Supervisory Board and Board of Management of Tata Steel Netherlands and the process will move to the next stage including due diligence and stakeholders’ consultations."" The Netherlands unit has an annual capacity of 7.5 million tonne and has 10,000 employees.Proceeds from the sale will be used to lower the debt on the company's books. Tata Steel Europe has a debt of 1.7 billion Euros.Simultaneously, the company has also begun the process of separating Tata Steel Netherlands and Tata Steel UK, and ""will pursue separate strategic paths for the Netherlands and the UK business in the future"", it said. The company has been in talks with the UK government for financial aid to shore up its operations in the country.""There will be stages in this transaction, and will close it in six to nine months,"" Executive Director and CFO Koushik Chatterjee, said during an analyst call on November 13.CEO and Managing Director TV Narendran added that the company is ""not expecting competition commission issues"" like in its earlier proposed merger with Germany's thyssenkrupp.The merger with thyseenkrupp was blocked by the European Commission in 2019, and turned out to be a big setback for Tata Steel in its attempt to find a solution to the European puzzle. Since its 2006 acquisition of Corus, which was later renamed Tata Steel Europe, the operations have for most of the years incurred losses and were dependent on the Indian parent to stay afloat.The Commission had said that the merged entity, which would have been the second largest in Europe after ArcelorMittal, would have hurt competition in some of the segments, including  packaging steel, auto-grade steel and electrical steel.The company is now hoping that the deal with SSAB will have a better fate with the Commission. Narendran said that the merged entity, that of Tata  Steel Netherlands and SSAB, won't have a significant presence in packaging or auto steel.SSAB is known for making steel that is used in making machinery and equipment that have application in mining, earth moving and construction segments.What happens to Tata Steel UK?The big question is now on the future of the UK operations, which have been the biggest drag on the company. Overall in Europe, about 70 to 80 percent of the EBITDA comes from the Dutch unit.The UK operations, which churn out about 5 million tons of steel a year, have been a subject of much debate and consternation, as was again seen during the analyst call on Friday, as many analysts repeatedly asked about the future of the unit.Narendran reiterated that the focus of the company is make the UK operations self-sustainable and not dependent on cash injections from the Indian parent. ""In the last six months, which have been very challenging, the UK operations have not needed help,"" he said."

Also, L&T Special Steels & Heavy Forgings and Kalyani Carpenter Special Steels Ltd, are among other players.""But some of the automakers, especially the multinational ones, prefer to source steel from companies of their own countries,"" says a senior executive from a private steel maker.Otherwise too, adds another executive, only 2 percent of the specialised steel used in the auto sector, is at present imported.Even in electrical steel, it is only some of the niche products that are imported.

""You have to exponentially speed up,"" he said.Red-tape and multiple permissions needed for exploring and producing oil and gas have in the past led to several slippages in the committed timelines.""Tell us, if you need more help,"" Pradhan said asking explorers to give suggestions on improving the regulatory environment. ""Business as usual cannot work.""The minister also wanted the data repository set up by his ministry''s upstream nodal agency, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), to be remodelled on lines of the National Geoscience Data Repository (NGDR) of the mines ministry.He wanted the data repository, which houses geological data of Indian sedimentary basins, to become an independent profit centre.The NGDR is a public-private initiative for all non-coal and non-fuel resources.The government had offered 11 blocks for exploration and production of oil and gas in OLAP-V.A total of 12 bids, including seven bids by ONGC and four by OIL, were received for the 11 blocks on offer at the close of bidding on June 30.

Both voice and data traffic surged.Reliance Retail: Against the backdrop of a challenging environment, where store functioning and digital commerce fulfilment was severely impacted by lockdown and restrictions (50 percent stores were fully shut, 29 percent partially operated), Reliance Retail clocked significant revenues of Rs 31,633 crore and EBITDA of Rs 1,083 crore in the quarter, company said.""The performance whilst muted by the operating context, was well ahead of market,"" it added. Retail revenue in June quarter 2019 was at Rs 38,216 crore and EBITDA at Rs 2,060 crore.RIL said EBITDA was positive and resilient despite the limitations in the quarter, with cost management initiatives leading to fixed cost savings, which helped cushion the impact of lower profits from lower sales.Despite gross margin expansion and cost savings, EBITDA margin was impacted by fixed costs and adverse mix (with the most profitable Fashion & Lifestyle categories being hit the hardest), coming in at 3.8 percent during the quarter against 6.0 percent during the corresponding period of the previous year, it added.Reliance said the quarter saw 21 percent growth year-on-year across the operational businesses of Grocery and Connectivity, while Consumer Electronics and Fashion and Lifestyle businesses were hit particularly hard by the cessation of activity during the lockdown period, as stores were closed for the most part of the quarter.On the petrochemicals front, Reliance said revenue for Q1FY21 declined by 33 percent YoY to Rs 25,192 crore primarily due to lower price realizations with disruptions in local and regional markets amid COVID-19 outbreak.EBITDA for the quarter declined 49.7 percent YoY to Rs 4,430 crore. ""Weak domestic demand and higher share of exports impacted margins as compared to regional benchmarks. The impact of lower realization was partially offset by cost optimization and integration benefits,"" company said.Q1 was a very challenging quarter as due to lockdown, domestic industry and supply chains virtually came to a halt as both producers and converters shut down plants across India, it added.In case of refining and marketing business, Reliance said revenues for June quarter 2020 declined by 54.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 46,642 crore due to lower crude oil price and lower throughput.Brent crude price averaged at $29.2 a barrel during the quarter versus $68.8 a barrel in Q1FY20, down 57.6 percent YoY.Regional Benchmark Singapore Complex Margins turned negative for the first time in 2 decades and averaged at $-0.9 a barrel.Reliance said its gross refining margins at $6.3 a barrel was impacted by lower product cracks and narrower light-heavy crude differential. However, it maintained a significant premium of $7.2 a barrel over regional benchmark margin.Refining and marketing EBITDA declined to Rs 3,818 crore (down 25.8 percent YoY) due to weak margin environment and lower throughput, RIL said, adding refining segment profitability was sustained through optimized crude procurement, relatively higher utilization, cost management and agile product placement.RIL is now one of the 50 most valued companies globally with a market capitalisation of Rs 13.92 lakh crore at its record high price.Promoters' shareholding stood at 50.37 percent in the June quarter up from 50.07 percent in the March quarter, while foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) raised their stake to 24.72 percent from 24.05 percent in the same period.Find all earnings related news here(This is a developing story.

We have taken help of external expertise, understood what needs to be done further and have substantially implemented the inputs to strengthen our IT infrastructure and systems,” Jagdishan said in a letter to customers.“Unexpectedly another incident happened on November 21,2020, and the primary reason for the same is the power outage in our primary data centre. We are working on war footing to strengthen this area also now,” Jagdishan said.Jagdishan assured customers that there is no reason to worry. “You can continue to transact with the bank without any concern,” he said.Jagdishan apologised for the digital outage to customers. “We realize that as our valued customer, you expect us to maintain a very high standard of service quality and experience. And sometimes, we have not been able to live up to your expectations. For that, please accept our sincere apologies,” the CEO said in the letter.The RBI asked HDFC Bank to temporarily halt sourcing new credit cards and stop the launch of its digital business-generating activities planned under Digital 2.0 and other proposed business generating IT applications.The RBI issued the order dated December 2, 2020, to HDFC Bank.The central bank on November 23 had sought an explanation from HDFC Bank after its digital services faced disruptions on the evening of November 21 till November 22 morning - for over 12 hours.The order also states that HDFC Bank’s board must examine the lapses and fix accountability.“The above measures shall be considered for lifting (the restrictions) upon satisfactory compliance with the major critical observations as identified by the RBI,” it added.New launches after RBI’s clearanceJagdishan said the bank will now launch its digital initiatives after getting the RBI’s approvals.“Some of our strategic digital initiatives to improve the front-end digital experience, improve digital origination, straight through processing, next generation of mobile and internet banking, API-based banking on the edge etc would now be readied and launched post the approval and clearance from the regulator,” the CEO said in the letter.Further, the bank will work with experts and the regulator to fortify the identified areas for improvement. “Internally, we are looking at this as an opportunity to further improve ourselves and emerge stronger,” Jagdishan said.Banks are under immense pressure because of the competition to come up with new digital banking products, often without proper testing and leading to such failures, said senior bankers. “There is intense competition from industry and new players such as payments banks to keep introducing new products. In their anxiety to remain at the top, banks often come with digital banking products that are not fully tested. Banks need to be careful to make sure they have enough technology capabilities to back such products,” said Naresh Malhotra, a senior banking consultant.To be fair, technical glitches aren’t limited to HDFC Bank alone. Other banks too have been facing problems on the technical side, with the latest instance reported on State Bank of India’s (SBI's) mobile banking application, YONO, in the last two days with customers complaining on Twitter that they are unable to login to the application following an error.

98,HDFC Bank,03-Nov-20,Large banks hold up well in Q2 but experts say too early to celebrate,1,"The September quarter earnings show that most banking players, especially the larger ones, held up well despite the coronavirus outbreak but experts say the sector is not completely out of woods yet.Most large private banks reported improved net profits for the second quarter and a modest increase in bad loans, experts said.Top private-sector lenders such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank posted a strong sequential improvement in their profits. They also reported sequential improvement in their gross non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio.The impact of staggered roll back of lockdown restrictions, or “Unlocking”, and resumption of economic activities is visible in the banks’ quarterly results.The opening up of the economy also led to an improvement in loan repayment and a major reduction in the moratorium book but it may be too early to celebrate.Looming uncertaintyA clear picture of how COVID-19 hit the banking sector will emerge only after some quarters once the Reserve Bank of India's support wounds up.According to experts, the challenges for the sector range from an increase in slippages from moratorium books, restructuring the percentage of the loan book to quality growth.Devang Mehta, Head – Equity Advisory, Centrum Wealth Management, said the actual picture of the COVID blow to banks will only emerge over the next couple of quarters, as special dispensations provided by the RBI start to wind down.The gross NPA numbers do not show the full picture of stressed accounts for private banks, he said. It is, however, important to remember that these banks have been providing aggressively during the first six months of this financial year.Nirali Shah, Senior Research Analyst, Samco Securities has a similar view.""Prima facie, it appears that the banking sector managed to tide through one more quarter amid the pandemic with healthy profitability and a modest increase in bad loans. But, the actual pain could emerge only after a few quarters when the special dispensations provided by the RBI start to dwindle,"" Shah said.Shah sees a number of challenges.""The top challenge is reporting of NPLs. Even though most banks have reported sequential improvement in their asset quality, the truth is that the reported NPAs may not have captured all the stress on the bank’s balance sheet. In fact, a proforma number has been reported as the apex court has asked lenders not to classify any new account as NPA after August 31, 2020. This will very well push the NPAs to a future date, causing banks to delay their provision requirement,"" Shah said.Another challenge lies in the amounts reported as restructured loans, which are extremely small to date, he said. The true proportions of restructuring will emerge in the quarters ending December and March.“Collection efficiency reported by banks is still running below their pre-COVID-19 levels, especially on the unsecured side which will be a key measure to watch out for going forward,” said Shah. The road ahead is challenging and a clear picture will be visible only in the quarters to come, he added.As per the RBI’s June 2020 financial stability report, the bad loan rate is expected to climb to 14.2 percent in a severe stress scenario and 12.5 percent in a baseline scenario as of March 2021, which is a bit alarming. Due to standstill benefits banks didn’t recognise further slippages in Q2FY21 but in the next two-three quarters, NPAs are expected to rise.The improvement in collection efficiency after the end of the moratorium on August 31 is positive.September,” Jehan Bhadha, Assistant Vice President - Equity Research at Nirmal Bang said.This figure is expected to improve further by the December quarter.

He said that due to the pandemic, individuals ability to repay loans has reduced significantly while 90 percent of the banks' books is in moratorium.""The crisis has increased the health costs and the average individual household needs money while banks at the same time will have to be more cautious. A vicious negative cycle has set in while discretionary spending has hit an all time low"", Chaudhary said.At Axis, he said the bank has been able to raise capital to provide comfort to the depositors while the provision coverage ratio has gone up from 70 per cent to 124 per cent. Chaudhary said that the bank had also been modernising its monitoring aspects leading to fall in GNPA and NNPA levels.According to him, the banking system will have to opt for more granular mode using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) which will form the basis of lending decisions.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Chaudhary also said that data points like credit card payments and salary pay-outs will also be used for taking a lending decision. This, he said, will be supplemented by robust underwriting, also determine the long-term survival potential of the sectors and also look at the history of the promoters who are seeking loans.Chaudhary said Axis bank had activated its quick response team before the crisis surfaced in India looking at the experience of China.He also said that for the first time, stress is building up in the retail sector putting the banks in a precarious situation which will have an impact on the price of loans and interest rates."

119,Axis Bank,04-Nov-20,Buy Axis Bank; target of Rs 600: ICICI Direct,1,"ICICI Direct's research report on Axis BankIn Q2FY21, Axis Bank reported net interest income (NII) growth of 20% YoY to Rs 7326 crore. Strong NII growth was driven by expansion in net interest margin (NIM), which jumped 7 bps YoY, 18 bps QoQ to 3.58%. Sequential 18 bps expansion in NIM was due to 3 bps from capital raise, 5 bps from lower interest reversals and 10 bps from better liquidity management. From Q1FY21, the bank is adding some amount in NII reserve. As a result, NIM was negatively impacted by 5 bps. Other income for the quarter increased 47% sequentially to Rs 3807 crore, which was on account of 67% QoQ rise in the fee income (insurance distribution surged). Cost to income ratio declined 90 bps QoQ to 38.0%. Part of this can be attributed to relatively lower business volumes as a result of less cost. PAT for the quarter increased 51.3% QoQ to Rs 1683 crore compared to a loss of Rs 112 crore.OutlookThe management held its guidance to remain well above industry credit growth, though it is currently cautious on certain segments. It can see minimal loans going for restructuring (estimated 1.6% of loans). Strong capital position, healthy operating metrics and reasonable prudence in provisioning provides comfort for steady earnings visibility and return ratios reaching 0.9% RoA and ~9% RoE by FY22. We value the bank at 1.6x FY22E ABV to arrive at a revised TP of Rs 600 (from Rs 530).

130,Infosys,26-Nov-20,Can IT services firms gain from the massive Covid-19 vaccine rollout?,1,"Bengaluru-based IT major Infosys last week launched a solution for Covid-19 vaccine management. Earlier, US-based Accenture, too, had launched a similar solution to support vaccination programmes and vaccine-distribution activities.So, what have IT services firms to gain from the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines? Quite a bit. The world is staring at a vaccination drive for billions of people. Many countries, including India, are allocating budgets and drawing up plans to make this rollout as smooth as possible.All these are being done on a scale never seen before and in a very short time. This presents a huge business opportunity not just for biotech firms, pharmaceuticals or logistics players but also for tech firms.Where does the opportunity lie?The opportunities for tech firms are in two key areas: patient management and cold chain monitoring.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Karthikeyan Natarajan, COO of Hyderabad-based IT Services firm Cyient, has some insights on the potential. Cyient is looking to tap into opportunities in vaccine management, such as cold chain monitoring.Natarajan explained that the job is not done just about administration of vaccines. “Say (for instance) 10 million vaccines are administered in Hyderabad or Mumbai. How do you really know that it has gone well and it has not reacted,” he asked.Follow Moneycontrol's COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker here.“So, it is not so much about saying that I am done with the injection; if you are a vaccine producer, you have to map the whole lifecycle,” he added.“You need to use a lot of digital tools from a patient-management standpoint before administration, during and post,” he added.Managing cold chainsPatient management is just one aspect. The other is managing cold chains. Pfizer’s vaccine, which has shown more than 95 percent efficacy in phase-3 trials, needs to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius. Moderna’s vaccine would need -20 degrees Celsius storage and AstraZeneca needs to be refrigerated at 2-8 degrees.These cold-storage chains need to be managed. For instance, it would be important to monitor how soon these vaccines need to be administered and also check for spoilage. According to a Scientific American report, once Pfizer’s vaccine is transferred to a refrigerator, it has to be administered within five days. Also, during distribution, there could be chances of vaccines being spoilt. According to the report, this spoilage could be anywhere between 5-20 percent.The Internet of things can be used to monitor the temperature and keep a check on vaccine vials “so that you know which ones got exposed to higher temperatures for a longer duration and segregate them”, he explained.The scale at which this needs to be managed is huge and would require technological intervention, where tech services firms come into play.Role of tech services in vaccine managementA case in point is the announcement by the Australian State of Victoria, which recently announced a tender for a Covid-19 vaccine management solution. The State said it is looking to select a private contractor who can deliver cloud-based software to manage the entire process of the vaccine rollout.Infosys and Accenture have jumped into the fray to develop solutions.Infosys’ vaccine management solution, developed by Simplus (which it acquired recently), and hosted on the Salesforce cloud, offers solutions for individuals and healthcare service providers. While individuals can use the platform to find solutions and schedule appointments, providers can use it to maintain inventory, log vaccine administration details and document adverse effects.Accenture’s solution, built on the Salesforce platform, includes contract tracing and managing the supply chain. It uses analytics to allocate vaccine supply and also monitor the dosage regime.How big an opportunity is there?There is a lot riding for firms involved in the vaccine drive. The cost of slipups is huge and their reputation could take a massive hit, pointed out analysts, explaining why the role tech service providers play would be important. However, the opportunity is tough to quantify, as vaccine management alone would not result in substantial revenue, say analysts and executives.Pareekh Jain, founder, Pareekh Consulting, agreed that the vaccine drive is unlikely to bring in substantial revenue for IT services firms. But, he added, it allows companies to expand their footprint into healthcare.Jain explained that so far, IT firms; exposure to core pharmaceutical operations is small as they use their in-house team. However the sheer scale of operations amid Covid-19 can give them an entry point to move beyond legacy operations by leveraging their data analytics and AI solutions to gain a bigger market, he added.In the wake of Covid-19, healthcare was one of the few sectors that grew for IT services firms. The last six months saw huge investments coming into pharmaceuticals, medical devices and predictive healthcare, some of which are likely to stay. This could also provide more opportunities."

New proposed immigration regulations in USA could impact onsite wage costs, granting of visas, tenure of visas, and overall costs of compliance.""Our localisation programme across USA, Europe and Australia, launched three years ago, mitigates many of these,"" Infosys Chief Operating Officer Pravin Rao said at a recent analyst meet.He added that Infosys has eight innovation hubs across the US and the EU, nine global Digital Studios (including a 5G lab in Melbourne) and seven global cyber defense centres.""We are close to 63 percent visa-independent in the US and over 50 percent in Europe and ANZ.

Infosys had clocked 8.5 percent year-on-year rise in revenue to Rs 24,570 crore in the September 2020 quarter.Infosys had 2,40,208 employees at the end of the said quarter. It does not provide a region-specific break-up of the headcount.Rao said that through academia partnerships with institutes like Purdue, Trinity and RISD, the company has trained a large number of employees as well, and is leveraging the training and reskilling programmes that it has built with partners.""We recently launched reskill and restart platform, which will play a crucial role in hiring local talent. We will bring a specific focus on building pathways for those that have been impacted by the economic downturn,"" he said adding that Infosys is also expanding its presence in nearshore locations like Mexico and Canada.Asked if Infosys will rethink its strategy as the approach of the president-elect on the visa issue appears to be more liberal, Rao said it is still early days to comment.""It is early days to see what the approach of the new regime is towards visa and by and large many of the things we saw during the Trump regime had bipartisan support as well.""We may see some changes from the Trump regime, but it will not go back to the old pre-Trump days,"" he added.He added that from a strategic perspective, Infosys'' approach of localisation is ""probably the right one"".""This is what we anticipated about three years back and we are seeing huge success and we have benefited from it and it is likely to continue,"" Rao said.Indian IT players are keeping a close watch on US president-elect Joe Biden''s approach and policies related to H-1B work visas that are used by a large number of Indian technology professionals. Biden is to be sworn in as the US president on January 20, 2021.In June, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Donald Trump administration had banned the entry into the US of workers in several key non-immigrant visa categories, including H-1B, until the end of the year, arguing that they eat into American jobs.Those affected include the family members of the H-1B, L-1, and certain categories of J1 visas. Later, certain exemptions in H-1B and L-1 travel bans were announced for those continuing employment with the same employer.

The company impressed with a second consecutive quarter of strong margin expansion (270bp QoQ in 2Q; ~420bp over 1HFY21). We expect some margin benefits to be sustainable (driven by automation, etc.). On the other hand, tailwinds (such as increased offshoring, lower attrition, deferred wage hikes, and lower travel/SGA costs) as a result of the pandemic are likely to partly wane out later on as the situation normalizes further over the next few quarters.

164,ITC,08-Nov-20,ITC's 20% drop in Q2 net could be masking a strategic shift in its FMCG business,0,"Diversified business conglomerate ITC's nearly 20 percent drop in profits in second quarter-ended September 30, 2020 may well be masking a strategic shift towards consistently strengthening its fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) business, a segment that has otherwise remained largely ignored among investors and analysts.The company's net profit during the quarter fell to Rs 3,232.4 crore during the quarter, compared to Rs 4,023.1 crore in the same period last year, meeting street estimates.Revenue from the FMCG and 'Others' segment, however, clocked a 18.4 percent growth on a comparable basis (excluding lifestyle retailing business for which restructuring is underway, as also the education and stationery products business that has been seriously impacted by the closure of educational institutions).A disaggregated analysis points towards a strategic tilt towards FMCG in recent years.In the current financial year during the quarter-ended September 30, 2020, EBITDA for the FMCG segment grew 66 percent, while EBITDA margins for the segment expanded 300 basis points to 9.7 percent.In the first half of the year, it launched over 70 new products in what appears to be part of an ambitious expansion plan identifying the FMCG segment as the company's main growth driver, with focus on new products, bold acquisitions and the high-octane marketing.In May, it announced the decision to acquire Kolkata-based spice maker Sunrise Foods Pvt. Ltd (SFPL), seen as part of a wider strategy to fortify its position in the country's highly competitive FMCG market that is dominated by large corporations such as Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) and several local players in diverse regional geographies.The earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortisation (EBITDA) of the new FMCG businesses has more than doubled in three years— growing from from Rs 456 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 914 crores in 2019-20.Over an eight-year period, segment EBIDTA for the FMCG businesses has multiplied from Rs 44 crore in 2012-13, a year before current Chairman Sanjiv Puri was elevated to president of the company’s FMCG business, to Rs 914 crore in 2019-20, galloping at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 54 percent.These may well be pointers for analysts and investors on what could be coming, particularly in the foods business with brands such as Aashirvaad (Rs 6,000 crore), Sunfeast (Rs 4,000 crore), Bingo (Rs 2,700 crore) and YiPPee (Rs 1,300 crore), achieving significant value and scale.The restructuring of the lifestyle retailing business with the sale of the John Players brand are all measures to improve profitability of the FMCG segment.There also appears to be a tactical shift in marketing initiatives with considerable focus on engagements with properties such as IPL, fitness and hygiene through Sunfeast, Bingo and Savlon."

Operating margins contracted 1184 bps mainly impacted by negative operating leverage & excise hike earlier in budget. Net profit de-grew 26.2%.OutlookWith the end of capex cycle in most businesses (except FMCG), we believe capital allocation has been rationalised. With more than Rs 20,000 crore of cash & liquid investment and consistent free cash flow generation of Rs 10,000-12000 crore, we expect Rs 20/share including special dividend in FY21E.

229,Maruti Suzuki,08-Dec-20,"Recovery in full speed: Cars, SUVs record best-ever November sales",1,"After a fall in October, sales of cars and SUVs have swung back in the green - registering their best-ever numbers for November, following an upbeat demand during the Diwali period.Retail sales of passenger vehicles (car, SUV and vans) for November stood at 291,001 units, as per data shared by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA), registering a growth of 4 percent compared to November 2019.Retail sales, which are bought by the final customer, are the real barometer of market demand as they represent the actual vehicle registration done by the regional transport offices (RTOs).Pan-India retail volumes are estimated to be slightly above 330,000 units November, as per Maruti Suzuki India. Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Lakhshadweep which make up 15-20 percent of the retail volumes are not part of the central government’s Vahan portal from where FADA sources the retail volumes.FADA also shared retail volumes for the entire 42-day festive period which started with Navratri in October and ended with Diwali in November. The industry saw a 14 percent increase in retail volumes to 431,597 units as against the same 42-day period last year.New launches such as Kia Sonet, Mahindra Thar, Hyundai i20, Toyota Urban Cruiser provided the boost to retail sales.Vinkesh Gulati, president, FADA said, “Automobile industry has seen one of the best recovery rates since unlocking began as November saw positive momentum. New launches especially in the compact SUV segment continued to show good demand in the PV segment.”Two-wheeler retail sales remained in the red in November like each of the previous months. The segment registered a 21 percent decline in volumes to 1.41 million units during November compared to the same month in 2019. In contrast, wholesales grew by 13 percent to 1.59 million units during the same month.The two-wheeler segment posted a drop in volumes during the 42-day festive period too. The category saw 6 percent decline in volumes to 1.9 million units during November as against the same month last year.While for the PV segment inventory days continue to be very low at 25-30 days (usual is 35-40 days) for the two-wheeler segment the inventory days were higher at 45-50 days (usual is 35-45 days)."
230,Maruti Suzuki,07-Dec-20,Why did Maruti Suzuki sales fall in November 2020?,1,"Maruti Suzuki became the only carmaker in the top five category to register a drop in sales in November 2020. This came on the back of two consecutive months of robust double-digit growths. Sales of the Alto and Swift maker fell by 2.4 percent during November while the industry grew by 9 percent during the same month.So was it demand fatigue, fierce competition or a combination of both behind the fall, which has spooked market watchers? None, as per a company official. The real reason behind the fall was due to the record low factory inventory and production shortages.Speaking to Moneycontrol, Shashank Srivastava, executive director, marketing and sales, Maruti Suzuki India, said: “In November, our opening stock was very low. There was very little of it because we had record dispatches in October.”In October 2020, Maruti Suzuki dispatched around 166,000 units, which was its highest-ever in a month. But in November, the company recorded dispatches of 135,775 units as against 139,133 units recorded in the same month in 2019.“What we could dispatch in November was only what we were able to produce in November. The number of working days in our factories in November were much lesser. Still, we worked at full capacity, and produced 137,000 units for the domestic market (including the light truck Super Carry) and that’s what we dispatched,” added Srivastava. Supply chain (auto parts availability) is still an issue in the auto industry. Plus, Diwali holidays also hit factory output.Maruti's drop in November sales was the first since June, fuelling speculations that India’s consumer demand revival was short-lived and largely dependent on pent-up demand created due to the lockdown. This theory was amplified when Maruti’s mini segment comprising Alto and S-Presso recorded a fall of 15 percent in volumes during November. Following the easing of the lockdown restrictions, buyers have preferred pocket-friendly car models such as those from the mini segment to avoid taking public transport.The retail quotientWhile wholesales (company to dealers) did take a knock in November, retail (dealer to consumer) volumes remained upbeat, growing by 69 percent compared to the same month last year, claimed Srivastava.“Maruti Suzuki’s market share in the retail segment is still more than 50 percent and it has remained like that, right from the start of the year. It was 45 percent in November last year. We grew our retails by 69 percent compared to last year’s November. We sold 167,500 in November this year compared to 99,500 last year,” added Srivastava.Retail volumes remained high in November despite the discounts hitting a yearly low. At an estimated Rs 17,500, the average discount offered on a Maruti Suzuki car during November was the lowest since the start of the financial year. The highest discount was offered during the June quarter of Rs 25,000 per car at the wholesale level.“As the stocks are lower right now, one would see lower discount figures in December as it was in November. December would be even lower than November,” added Srivastava.How did Maruti’s rivals fare?Hyundai Motor India, which, like Maruti Suzuki, is also running its plants at full capacity, recorded a 9 percent growth in wholesale volumes in November. Tata Motors managed to keep up with its monthly production rate of November on par with the last few months. The Mumbai-based company doubled November wholesales compared to last year’s November."
231,Maruti Suzuki,05-Dec-20,"Maruti Suzuki's production in November up 6% at 1,50,221 units",1,"The country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India on December 5 said its total production in November increased 5.91 percent to 1,50,221 units.The company had produced total 1,41,834 units in the same month last year, Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) said in a regulatory filing. Passenger vehicles production stood at 1,46,577 units last month as compared with 1,39,084 units in November 2019, a growth of 5.38 percent.Production of mini cars comprising Alto and S-Presso models stood marginally up at 24,336 units last month as against 24,052 units in the year-ago period.Similarly, manufacturing of compact cars, comprising WagonR, Celerio, Ignis, Swift, Baleno, Dzire, stood at 85,118 units as against 78,133 units in November 2019, an increase of 8.93 percent, MSI said."
232,Maruti Suzuki,03-Dec-20,Toyota not to manufacture Suzuki Brezza at India plants,1,"Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL) on December 3 informed that the Suzuki Brezza will not be manufactured by Toyota at its Bengaluru plant in 2022.  Another unidentified model will be produced in its place, the car market leader said.This change brings curtains on the agreement that allowed Maruti to source the Brezza from Toyota. In March 2019, the board of Maruti Suzuki cleared proposals to partly source the Brezza compact sports utility vehicle (SUV) from Toyota Kirloskar Motors (TKM) as a part of the broader non-equity based agreement signed between Suzuki and Toyota in February 2017.The change comes barely 20 months after Toyota and Suzuki agreed to share models as part of the broader international agreement between the two companies. Toyota sources the Brezza from Maruti Suzuki but not before it is rebadged, marketed and sold as Urban Cruiser from its own showrooms.“Vide our letter dated March 27, 2019, we had informed you about the decision of the Board to manufacture Vitara Brezza at the existing plant of Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) starting year 2022. The Board has, today, approved to change the model to be manufactured at TKM from Vitara Brezza to another model,” said MSIL in a statement sent to the BSE.Brezza is the second model supplied by Suzuki to Toyota in India with the first being the Maruti Suzuki Baleno which is rebadged as Toyota Glanza. The Urban Cruiser was launched by Toyota in early October in India being priced higher than the Maruti Brezza.MSIL declined to comment when approached for further clarity on the matter including the reason behind the sudden change. The copy will be updated with TKM’s comments as soon as they are shared.Last year, Suzuki even dabbled with the idea of moving the entire production of the Brezza to Toyota plants. This would have allowed MSIL to free up capacity at its Haryana plant which also makes the Urban Cruiser.Following the launch of Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, Maruti’s share in the compact SUV segment has recorded a slide. From being the largest SUV maker in India MSIL’s position in the compact SUV segment has come down to the third spot."
233,Maruti Suzuki,02-Dec-20,November auto sales show YoY rise in volume; brokerages name 8 stocks to look at,1,"On expected lines, most automakers witnessed a rise in monthly volume on a year-on-year (YoY) basis for the month of November even though volume declined on a month-on-month basis.As the festival period is over, it was expected that the demand will ease on monthly basis.A significant pick-up in demand was seen for commercial vehicles (CV) while passenger vehicles (PV), two-wheelers (2W) and tractors also did well.Ashutosh Tiwari, Head of Research at Equirus Securities pointed out there was an element of pent-up demand as sales were lower in Q1FY21, but the shift towards personal mobility was also a reason behind demand pick up.""Sales also benefited from increased savings of service class and government employees as there were limited avenues for spending since the COVID outbreak. Lower finance cost is also helping demand,"" Tiwari said.As the economy is improving and the vaccine for COVID-19 looks near, is the road for automakers going to be smooth now?Brokerages and analysts expect volumes to improve in the coming quarters on strong rural sentiment, low-interest rates, improving finance availability and a gradual pick-up in the business and economic activity.""We believe that post the festive season, the inventory for passenger car OEMs is below the average 30-day levels, which has led to the growth. Over the rest of the year, we expect sales trends to be better than what was earlier expected as the economy is gradually normalising,"" said Aditya Makharia, Institutional Research Analyst (Auto), HDFC Securities.However, the road for all segments is not going to be the same.""Festive season sales were reasonable, with no major negative surprise. Current demand and low inventory sentiment in PV and tractor suggest higher wholesales in the coming months. On the flip side, 2W and CV OEMs are expected to maintain a cautious stance, with no major inventory push,"" said brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services.""Valuations reflect for recovery to sustain in the coming quarters, leaving a limited margin for safety for any negative surprises. Hence, we prefer companies with: a) higher visibility in terms of demand recovery, b) a strong competitive positioning, c) margin drivers, and d) balance sheet strength,"" Motilal Oswal added.Tiwari of Equirus Securities believes there is likely to be a sluggish period over the next 2-3 months due to seasonal weakness post festivals, but he expects demand to pick up again from March-April 2021 as rural demand will pick up post-harvest and with COVID cases subsiding even earnings of business class people will revive.Brokerage firm ICICI Securities pointed out that the rising incentive schemes across segments post-festive season, lack of price increase even in wake of higher input costs correlate with the fragility of the consumer sentiment.""We believe channel inventory clearance remains a key priority for December; thus, expect incentives to increase further by the end of Q3,"" ICICI Securities said.Pankaj Bobade, Head - Fundamental Research, Axis Securities is of the view with the festive season now over in India, the auto industry volumes to moderate in Q4FY21 as the pent-up demand is tapering down and fresh demand has to kick in to sustain the growth.""Generally, the December month witnesses tepid growth at the retail level, as the end-users await the vehicle with chassis plate of the new year. Hence, the short-term (2 months) outlook would be relatively soft compared to the festive season but we expect the auto industry to post a strong double-digit recovery over FY22 and FY23 on the back of improving fundamentals, a low base of FY20 and FY21 and recovery in the other sectors of the economy,"" Bobade said.Rusmik Oza, Executive Vice President and Head of Fundamental Research-PCG at Kotak Securities has a cautious view on the automobile sector as stock prices have rallied smartly on the back of better results and healthy volume growth.""We expect net profits of the automobiles sector to increase 11 percent in FY21 despite very low volumes in Q1FY21 (affected by the nation-wide lockdown in the months of April and May 2020),"" Oza said.For the medium-term, Oza expects the motorcycle industry to grow at 12-20 percent in FY22-23 after a sharp decline in FY21. He expects the domestic car industry to grow by 14-22 percent during FY22-23E after a sharp decline in FY21.""We expect a moderate decline in FY21E EBITDA margins of the OEMs given lower volumes that will result in negative operating leverage and higher costs related to the implementation of new fuel emission standards (BS-VI fuel standards applicable from April 1, 2020. We expect EBITDA margin to improve in FY22 on the back of higher volumes (positive operating leverage),"" Oza said.Mitul Shah, Head of Research at Reliance Securities believes that demand for automobiles would remain healthy over the medium to long-term, though the pace of growth may taper down.""We may see some slowdown over near-term due to post-festival effect, while FY22 would be strong for the sector with healthy double-digit growth,"" Shah said.Stocks to focusGlobal financial firm Morgan Stanley expects all segments of the auto sector to recover sharply in 2021.It expects growth to taper off in Q3 and rebound sharply in Q4.""Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Auto & Eicher Motors remain our preferred overweights. Motherson remains a top pick among suppliers,"" Morgan Stanley said.Brokerage firm CLSA highlighted that the volume recovery continued but lower than the peak in October.CLSA said it prefers deep cyclical plays such as Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland.Brokerage firm Emkay Global Securities said its top picks are Maruti Suzuki (Target price: Rs 8,216), Hero Motocorp (Target price: Rs 3,839) and Eicher Motors (Target price: Rs 3,025).Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal said Mahindra & Mahindra and Hero MotoCorp are its top OEM picks.Axis Securities likes Hero Motorcorp and Bajaj Auto in the two-wheeler space and expects Maruti to do well in the PV Segment. It expects Ashok Leyland to outperform as it is well-positioned to benefit from the cyclical upturn in the CV industry.Brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher likes Mahindra & Mahindra, Ashok Leyland, Maruti and Motherson Sumi.Reliance Securities prefers Ashok Leyland and Escorts within automobile space.Basudeb Banerjee, Research Analyst, Ambit Capital said his top picks in the OEM space are TVS Motors and Eicher Motors (Royal Enfield).""Premiumisation of two-wheelers is a long-term phenomenon and Royal Enfield will be the biggest beneficiary of that sustainably,"" he said."

This is an existential threat which could lock India out of the global ecosystem and slow down the pace of innovation. We could have let our citizens down if you allow that to happen,” Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal said while speaking at virtual India Mobile Congress 2020.The statement from Vittal followed a speech by RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani at the event, where he mentioned that Jio’s 5G network ""will be powered by indigenous-developed network, hardware and technology components”.Jio has sought spectrum in certain frequencies from the Department of Telecom for holding trials of the latest 5G technology.The company’s wholly-owned US-based subsidiary Radisys has already started selling some of the 5G solutions to foreign companies. Vittal said India should have an open ecosystem. He cited examples of CDMA and GSM to push his case.""CDMA was better technology, but GSM won because it was more accepted technology. More companies in the world embraced GSM. GSM won because it became part of the global ecosystem and CDMA died,” he added.He said that there is a need to create an India open ecosystem and promote applications developed for India and by India.""For this we have to come together. We have to set aside our differences and be part of one. Telcos, equipment players, device players, manufacturing companies, IT companies.

However, it may in turn be marginally EBITDA positive.OutlookWe assign EV/EBITDA of 11x to the India Wireless business and 6x to the Africa business on FY22E. Subsequently, we arrive at an SOTP-based TP of INR650.

250,Bharti Airtel,30-Oct-20,Buy Bharti Airtel; target of Rs 663: Dolat Capital Market,1,"Dolat Capital Market's research report on Bharti AirtelBharti reported strong all-round beat in Q2FY21 across both India Wireless and Africa. A solid 14mn subscriber, 14.5mn 4G additions, 3.4% QoQ ARPU (computed 5.5%) in India Wireless and 5mn sub adds in Africa with 8.8% QoQ ARPU growth were key highlights. Other business segments too especially DTH reported healthy performance. Bharti’s strong business trajectory, reasonable valuations (~8/6.4x FY21/22E EV/EBITDA) should re-impose investor confidence and lead to reversal of some of its recent underperformance. While tariff increase is a welcome potential trigger and inevitable for a threeplayer market structure, Bharti is well-poised to gain market share and grow even in absence of the same.OutlookIn our view, Investors would be better-off not-losing the sight on long-term potential upsides for short-term delay in tariff hikes.

The fall in Bharti Airtel was due to negative news flows. Reduced weightage in MSCI and FTSE also added pressure and has dragged the stock lower. Recently, the Nifty witnessed long liquidation. Due to that, the October series of Nifty open interest (OI) is one of the lowest seen in the last 10 years. At the same time, most of the stock futures have started the October series with significantly low open interest. In contrast, the OI in Bharti has remained prominent while the current OI in the stock is the highest seen in the last 10 year. We believe the recent short positions in the stock are still intact.

The EBITDA margin at 23.6%, up ~470 bps YoY led by benign raw material prices and saving in other expenditure in Q2FY21. On the revenue front, sales growth at ~6% YoY was led by double digit (I-direct estimate: ~10%) volume growth in Q2FY21. Despite being a lean season on account of monsoons, the strong decorative volume growth is attributable to significant pent up demand in rural and semi urban regions led by repainting/maintenance activities. Gradual opening up of metro regions along with inventory build-up in the wake of festive seasons at dealer would have also help drive the volume growth in Q2FY21. We believe normalisation in metro regions, revival in the real estate industry and intact repainting demand from semi-urban, rural India would drive paint demand, going forward. Besides, we believe favourable raw material prices are likely to keep gross margins elevated in the coming quarters even with a change in product mix. This, coupled with rationalisation of other costs would help drive EBITDA margin, going forward. We revise our revenue, earnings estimates upside by 6% and 33%, respectively, for FY21E factoring in the current quarter performance.

With 221 bps lower advertisement spends, HUL was able to maintain its operating margins at 25.1% (27 bps up). Net profit increased 8.7% to Rs 2009 crore.

Equity IRR for its eight commissioned TBCB projects varies in the range of 2-27%. TBCB currently remains small in the overall context (3% FY20 PAT; 5% gross block). However, with increased awarding at the interstate/intrastate level on a TBCB basis, its pie would eventually grow. Over the past one year, PWGR has won ~7 projects on a TBCB basis. We expect profits from TBCB projects to rise to INR7.8b in FY23 from INR3.7b as new projects get commissioned.OutlookHowever, subsequent lower capital expenditure (along with the removal of DDT) also implies potential for higher dividends. We expect DPS to rise to INR14.3/sh in FY22, from INR10/sh in FY20, implying FY22 dividend yield of ~8%. PWGR's stock trades at just 1.2x FY22E P/BV for steady long-term growth and an underpenetrated market.

Time Frame: Six months.Technical ViewThe IT sector remain in secular up trend since bottoming out in March 2020. As the major IT companies as trading at their all-time highs and are forming higher peak and higher trough in all time frame. The share price of Tech Mahindra is currently placed at the previous multiple high since February 2019 around Rs 840-850 levels. We expect the stock to resolve above the same and extend the current up move. Our expectation of resolving above the major hurdle of Rs 840-850 is based on the following key observations:a) the entire consolidation of the last eight months has taken the shape of a bullish rounding formation signalling a reversal of the corrective trend and resumption of fresh up move.b) it has witnessed a faster retracement as it has completely retraced its previous four quarter decline (Rs 846-471) in just two quarters.c) the last quarter up move is backed by strong volume of highest since CY 2009 highlighting larger participation.Hence, we expect the stock to continue with its positive momentum and head towards Rs 950 levels in the coming months as it is the 123.6% external retracement of the entire CY’20 decline (Rs 846-471).Fundamental ViewTech Mahindra is an IT service company catering to various segments like communication (~40%), manufacturing (~17%), technology, media & entertainment (~9%), Banking Financial, Services & insurance (~16%), retail transport & logistics (~7.3%) and others (11.2%). Geographically, the company generates ~49% revenues from Americas, 26% from Europe and 25% from rest of the world. The company is aiming to improve revenues and reaching industry leading growth by focusing on cross sell opportunities. The company is also increasing its. resource allocation to high growth geographies and reducing its focus on emerging & low growth geographies. Apart from improving revenues, the company is also rationalising cost to improve margins. The company aims to improve margins by improving margins of portfolio companies, lowering of discretionary spend, lower facility cost, lower travel cost, increased automation in some of the service lines, higher offshoring and benefits of large deal won in previous quarter. We believe ramp up of large deal won in previous quarters and improvement in deal wins in coming quarters will drive revenues. Further, in the long term, we believe its leadership in communication vertical will make it a key beneficiary of vendor consolidation in the segment. It would also benefit from 5G opportunities. Enterprise segment will also benefit from improved digital traction, success in large deals. Hence, we remain positive on the stock.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

416,Bajaj Auto,30-Nov-20,"Exclusive: Bajaj, KTM parent firm restart talks on stake transfer",1,"Bajaj Auto and partner KTM have restarted talks on transferring the 48 percent stake held by the Indian company in the Austrian bike maker back to its holding entity.Bajaj Auto’s 48 percent equity, along with the 51.7 percent stake held by Pierer Mobility AG, make up the shareholding of KTM AG, the legal entity that is responsible for making products under its own brand, Husqvarna and GasGas brands.KTM Group and Bajaj Auto are holding discussions to transfer the 48 percent stake of Bajaj Auto in KTM AG to the listed company Pierer Mobility AG. The discussions are being held between Bajaj Auto International Holding BV, the Netherlands-based subsidiary, and Pierer Industrie AG, the parent company of Pierer Mobility AG.Although finer details of the proposed realignment of the partnership has not been shared by either companies, sources say that this would kick-start a new chapter in the 13-year-old partnership that has so far seen joint design and development of products, common use of manufacturing facility, overseas distribution pact and joint marketing and sales.The two companies had held the same discussions in March 2019, with the transaction decision targeted to be made in the second quarter of the same year. But less than three months later, both companies aborted the plan for unspecified reasons.“Pierer Mobility AG was informed by Pierer Industrie AG and Bajaj that they have restarted discussions on assessing the possibility of transferring Bajaj's 48 percent stake in KTM AG to Pierer Mobility AG, with the Pierer Group continuing to retain the controlling majority over Pierer Mobility AG”, a statement from Pierer Mobility AG said.What is different this time is the proposal to make PTW Holding AG, a newly formed entity by KTM, the 60-percent stake holder in Pierer Mobility AG. This translates to transferring the said 60 percent stake from Pierer Industrie AG to PTW Holding.“Pierer Industrie AG and Bajaj will now evaluate the proposal in detail,” the statement further added.The authorised capital enables a capital increase of up to 50 percent of the existing share capital. After the transaction, the stake of Pierer Mobility AG in KTM AG will increase from the current 51.7 percent to approximately 99.7 percent, the statement added.KTM increases 2020 forecastThe announcement of restarting discussions of stake transfer comes less than two months after the Austrian bike maker increased the forecast for the second half of 2020, following sustained high demand for all brands including e-bikes.The management board of Pierer Mobility AG decided to increase the sales forecast published at the end of August 2020 for the second half of 2020 to over € 850 million (previously € 800 million). Around 64 percent of KTM’s revenues come from Europe, followed by North America, and Mexico with 17 percent.Riding on BajajThe partnership with Bajaj Auto made the Austrian company the world's biggest premium bike manufacturer, beating US heavyweight Harley-Davidson (in volumes) in 2018 and 2019.Of the 90,331 motorcycles sold in the first half of 2020, 22 percent was manufactured and sold by Bajaj Auto in India and Indonesia. In return, Bajaj has benefited from technology sharing and becoming the sole manufacturer of KTM and Husqvarna bikes outside of Europe, with exports reaching the US, Japan and South Asia.From worldwide volumes of 280,099 units clocked in 2019, KTM is expecting to sell around 400,000 two-wheelers in 2022. This will include nearly doubling of production at Bajaj Auto’s Chakan, Pune-based plant to 200,000 units, from around 108,000 units at present. This will include a mix of joint products (of KTM and Husqvarna bands) and KTM products distributed by Bajaj on a licence fee model.The two companies have also started work on electric two-wheelers. The first of such e-bikes having power range between 3 and 10 kW (48 volts) will roll off the Chakan production line. The platform will support various product variants under the brand of both the partners.KTM is developing a 4kW electric scooter under the Husqvarna brand whose market launch is expected to take place in 2021. This will be followed by the launch of Husqvarna E-Pilen, a 4kW/10kW, fully electric motorcycle with modular battery system. The Husqvarna E-Pilen is expected to be launch-ready in 2022."
