250	Dolat Capital Market's research report on Bharti AirtelBharti reported strong all-round beat in Q2FY21 across both India Wireless and Africa. A solid 14mn subscriber, 14.5mn 4G additions, 3.4% QoQ ARPU (computed 5.5%) in India Wireless and 5mn sub adds in Africa with 8.8% QoQ ARPU growth were key highlights. Other business segments too especially DTH reported healthy performance. Bharti’s strong business trajectory, reasonable valuations (~8/6.4x FY21/22E EV/EBITDA) should re-impose investor confidence and lead to reversal of some of its recent underperformance. While tariff increase is a welcome potential trigger and inevitable for a threeplayer market structure, Bharti is well-poised to gain market share and grow even in absence of the same.OutlookIn our view, Investors would be better-off not-losing the sight on long-term potential upsides for short-term delay in tariff hikes. Reiterate BUY with revised TP of Rs 663 @ 10/6x Sep-22E EV/EBITDA for India Wireless/Africa.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Further, it announced exit from the Aerospace business, which had losses of INR3-4b in FY20.

EBITM expanded 270bps to 25.3% (highest quarterly margin since Q4FY16). Strong operating performance led to a net profit beat. For FY21, Infosys raised its revenue guidance to 2-3% YoY cc (from 0-2%) and EBIT margins range to 23-24% (from 21-23%). Its full-year outlook implies a 0.5-1.7% CQGR over the remaining two quarters.

119	ICICI Direct's research report on Axis BankIn Q2FY21, Axis Bank reported net interest income (NII) growth of 20% YoY to Rs 7326 crore. Strong NII growth was driven by expansion in net interest margin (NIM), which jumped 7 bps YoY, 18 bps QoQ to 3.58%. Sequential 18 bps expansion in NIM was due to 3 bps from capital raise, 5 bps from lower interest reversals and 10 bps from better liquidity management. From Q1FY21, the bank is adding some amount in NII reserve. As a result, NIM was negatively impacted by 5 bps. Other income for the quarter increased 47% sequentially to Rs 3807 crore, which was on account of 67% QoQ rise in the fee income (insurance distribution surged). Cost to income ratio declined 90 bps QoQ to 38.0%. Part of this can be attributed to relatively lower business volumes as a result of less cost. PAT for the quarter increased 51.3% QoQ to Rs 1683 crore compared to a loss of Rs 112 crore.OutlookThe management held its guidance to remain well above industry credit growth, though it is currently cautious on certain segments. It can see minimal loans going for restructuring (estimated 1.6% of loans). Strong capital position, healthy operating metrics and reasonable prudence in provisioning provides comfort for steady earnings visibility and return ratios reaching 0.9% RoA and ~9% RoE by FY22. We value the bank at 1.6x FY22E ABV to arrive at a revised TP of Rs 600 (from Rs 530).

295	ICICI Direct's research report on Asian PaintsAsian Paints reported stellar numbers with one of the best quarterly EBITDA margins in Q2FY21. The EBITDA margin at 23.6%, up ~470 bps YoY led by benign raw material prices and saving in other expenditure in Q2FY21. On the revenue front, sales growth at ~6% YoY was led by double digit (I-direct estimate: ~10%) volume growth in Q2FY21. Despite being a lean season on account of monsoons, the strong decorative volume growth is attributable to significant pent up demand in rural and semi urban regions led by repainting/maintenance activities. Gradual opening up of metro regions along with inventory build-up in the wake of festive seasons at dealer would have also help drive the volume growth in Q2FY21. We believe normalisation in metro regions, revival in the real estate industry and intact repainting demand from semi-urban, rural India would drive paint demand, going forward. Besides, we believe favourable raw material prices are likely to keep gross margins elevated in the coming quarters even with a change in product mix. This, coupled with rationalisation of other costs would help drive EBITDA margin, going forward. We revise our revenue, earnings estimates upside by 6% and 33%, respectively, for FY21E factoring in the current quarter performance.

385	Dolat Capital Market's research report on Power Grid CorporationQ1 revenues were largely in line (refer Exhibit 1), though PAT was ahead of estimates on higher surcharge and dividend income and lower interest costs. It has done a capex of Rs31bn, while capitalization was Rs106bn, during the quarter mainly due to Raipur Pugalur HVDC line of Rs95bn getting capitalised. It has maintained its guidance for a capex of Rs105bn and capitalization of Rs200-250bn in FY21. The current CWIP Rs282bn, while work in hand is Rs410bn. As capex reduces, we believe that it can increase dividend payouts going forward.

170	ICICI Direct's research report on ITCITC reported 17.4% decline in sales with cigarettes revenues seeing de-growth of 29.1%. The volume dip of 40% was better than our expectation given 45 days business loss. We believe trade (distributor, retailers) inventory would have depleted during lockdown despite retail shops staying closed. Preferred pack buying over loose cigarettes also helped restore volumes. These factors would have helped company to re-fill trade pipeline given manufacturing & supply chain operations normalised in June. The trade normally holds 14 days inventory. Comparable FMCG sales grew 12.2% with strong demand in staples, packages foods & hygiene product and steep decline in discretionary & stationary businesses. Operating margins contracted 1184 bps mainly impacted by negative operating leverage & excise hike earlier in budget. Net profit de-grew 26.2%.OutlookWith the end of capex cycle in most businesses (except FMCG), we believe capital allocation has been rationalised. With more than Rs 20,000 crore of cash & liquid investment and consistent free cash flow generation of Rs 10,000-12000 crore, we expect Rs 20/share including special dividend in FY21E.

390	Motilal Oswal 's research report on Power GridWe analyzed details of Power Grid (PWGR)'s tariff-based competitive bidding (TBCB) projects from their annual reports. At an aggregate level, in our view, PWGR should be able to generate ~14% equity IRR (assuming a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20 for its 11 under-construction projects). Equity IRR for its eight commissioned TBCB projects varies in the range of 2-27%. TBCB currently remains small in the overall context (3% FY20 PAT; 5% gross block). However, with increased awarding at the interstate/intrastate level on a TBCB basis, its pie would eventually grow. Over the past one year, PWGR has won ~7 projects on a TBCB basis. We expect profits from TBCB projects to rise to INR7.8b in FY23 from INR3.7b as new projects get commissioned.OutlookHowever, subsequent lower capital expenditure (along with the removal of DDT) also implies potential for higher dividends. We expect DPS to rise to INR14.3/sh in FY22, from INR10/sh in FY20, implying FY22 dividend yield of ~8%. PWGR's stock trades at just 1.2x FY22E P/BV for steady long-term growth and an underpenetrated market.

Being the first full quarter post the acquisition of THDC & NEEPCO, NTPC’s adjusted consolidated profit increased 21.3% to Rs38.5bn. The company’s core RoE remained strong at 19.5%, but fixed cost underrecovery was at Rs2.3bn (Rs1.2bn in Q1FY20). On Q1FY21 consolidated profit basis, annualised EPS comes to Rs15.4, Q1FY21-end RoE at 12.5% (pre-exception) and book value/share at Rs124.

The first 10 days of the festive season, even when compared to the corresponding (non-COVID) period last year, shows single-digit YoY growth. This, along with likely bunching up of wedding dates in 3QFY21, offers hope that recovery to normalcy may actually take place (compared to continued guidance for 4QFY21). However, we are still assuming 2% jewelry sales decline in 3QFY21 as (a) jewelry sales growth base was higher in 3QFY20 compared to 2QFY20, and (b) unfavorable gold price movements could affect near-term demand.OutlookWhile FY22E multiples at 55x may appear expensive, it is primarily due to temporary impact of the pandemic in FY21, from which the rebound would be sharp over the next couple of years.

Strong growth was driven by higher capitalisation at Rs. 11,877 crore in H1FY2021 (versus. Rs. 5,687 crore in H1FY20), higher other income, and lower tax rate. Management reiterated its asset capitalisation and capex guidance of Rs. 20,000 crore-25,000 crore and Rs. 10,500 crore, respectively, for FY2021E. Work in hands at Rs. 41,000 crore provides earnings visibility (expect an 11% PAT CAGR over FY2020-FY2023E). Power Grid targets to monetise 5 TBCB assets worth Rs. 7,164 crore in FY2021, which would help unlock value, while potential reduction in receivables (through power sector liquidity scheme) would improve balance sheet.OutlookHence, we recommend Buy on Power Grid with a PT of Rs. 220, given earnings visibility over FY2021E-FY2023E, attractive valuation of 1.2x FY2023E P/BV (31% discount to historical P/BV), and healthy dividend yield at 4%.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

140	Motilal Oswal 's research report on InfosysInfosys (INFO)’s 2QFY21 revenue and margin performance were above expectations. The company impressed with a second consecutive quarter of strong margin expansion (270bp QoQ in 2Q; ~420bp over 1HFY21). We expect some margin benefits to be sustainable (driven by automation, etc.). On the other hand, tailwinds (such as increased offshoring, lower attrition, deferred wage hikes, and lower travel/SGA costs) as a result of the pandemic are likely to partly wane out later on as the situation normalizes further over the next few quarters. The highest ever deal wins were reported (~USD3.15b), and the deal pipeline remains healthy. Upward revision to FY21 guidance – with revenue growth of 2–3% YoY CC (v/s 0–2% earlier) and margin guidance of 23–24% (v/s 21–23% earlier) – is positive, but still conservative. We expect Infosys to deliver above guidance in FY21 a) notwithstanding margin headwinds (wage hikes in 4Q, large deal ramp-up, seasonality, above margin factors, etc.) and b) based on strong deal wins. We upgrade our FY21/FY22E EPS estimates by 9%/12% as we adjust our revenue and EBIT margin trajectory. Infosys should be a key beneficiary in terms of recovery in IT spends in FY22. Additionally, leading operational performance in 1HFY21, coupled with strong deal wins, should translate to strong outperformance on EPS growth (v/s the sector). Reiterate Buy.OutlookAs Infosys has outperformed TCS in 1HFY21 and is on its way to an industry-leading performance in FY21 (amongst Tier I), we expect the divergence in the valuation to narrow (to 10%). On our revised estimates, the stock is currently trading at 21x FY22 EPS. We value the stock at 25x FY22E EPS (10% discount to TCS).

There was a considerable increase in demand for essentials (atta, biscuits), instant food (noodles) & entire hygiene portfolios (Savlon). The company expects Savlon sales (consumer spends) to reach Rs 1000 crore in FY21 (Rs 250 crore in FY20), which would become one of the largest brands in hygiene space despite clutter of new brands in category. Agri business also saw healthy 12.8% growth aided by export opportunity in rice, mustard, coffee. Value added products (spices, processed fruits, frozen snacks) posted 25% growth. Operating margins contracted 453 bps to 33.9% mainly due to cigarette sales decline, losses in hotels business. PAT de-grew 19.7% to Rs 3232.4 crore impacted by dip in operating profit, lower income tax in base quarter.OutlookGiven, the completion of capex in hotels segment and ITC not venturing into many newer FMCG categories, we believe the capital allocation would rationalise.

301	Sharekhan's research repor on Asian PaintsConstruction and painting activities have re-gained momentum especially in the tier III/IV towns. Further there is an emerging trend of consumer shifting to better quality paints (including puttys, distempers and emulsions) in the rural market. Asian Paints (APL), a leading player in the decorative paints segment, will benefit from the rural recovery and its volumes are likely to grow in double digits in the near term. In metros, a gradual recovery is likely from Q3FY2021. Benign input prices would continue to support margins; cost savings would help OPM improve q-o-q and stabilise in Q3FY2021.OutlookA sturdy balance sheet, consistent dividend payouts and focus on becoming a complete home improvement player makes APL a better pick in consumer goods space.

302	Dolat Capital's research report on Asian PaintsAPL’s Q1FY21 revenues, EBITDA and APAT came below our estimate due to delayed pick-up in demand compared to our expectation. Nevertheless, double digit volume growth (+14%) in June’20, was a key positive. We believe overall volume de-growth in Domestic Decorative business was 38% in Q1FY21. IB posted mixed results as better performance in Africa and ME was offset by Covid led slowdown in Nepal and Bangladesh. Considering mixed impact of double digit exit rate for the quarter and lockdowns in few states in July, we believe that growth would normalize in H2FY21E. Consequently, we have maintained our EPS estimates for FY21E and FY22E at Rs 26.4 and Rs 33.5 respectively. We arrive at a TP of Rs 1,840 (55x FY22E EPS). Given rich valuations, we maintain our Reduce rating. Buy on dips. We believe that the volume growth in the decorative segment should remain high, especially in rural areas, given better crop production this season. Further, ongoing government investments in rural infrastructure, and house construction in rural areas should partially mitigate overall slowdown.OutlookIn the long term, we remain optimistic about the paint industry, considering an expected shift from the unorganised to organised sector.

132	"Infosys has been ""intensely focused"" on skilling and generating local employment in markets like the US, which has helped the IT services major become about 63 percent visa-independent in the US and over 50 percent in Europe and Australia-New Zealand, a top company executive said.Infosys, which counts the US as its biggest market, said it is still early to comment on the approach the new US administration could take towards work visas but it expects to continue benefiting from its ongoing localisation efforts.""We continue to see challenges to mobility of talent. New proposed immigration regulations in USA could impact onsite wage costs, granting of visas, tenure of visas, and overall costs of compliance.""Our localisation programme across USA, Europe and Australia, launched three years ago, mitigates many of these,"" Infosys Chief Operating Officer Pravin Rao said at a recent analyst meet.He added that Infosys has eight innovation hubs across the US and the EU, nine global Digital Studios (including a 5G lab in Melbourne) and seven global cyber defense centres.""We are close to 63 percent visa-independent in the US and over 50 percent in Europe and ANZ. We have been intensely focused on creating jobs in the US for the past three years,"" he noted.In September, the Bengaluru-based firm had said it plans to hire 12,000 American workers over the next two years, taking its hiring commitment in the country to 25,000 over five years.Industry watchers say while IT companies have been ramping up their presence in the US and other markets, and hiring locals over the past few years to overcome visa-related challenges.North America is the largest market for Infosys, accounting for 60.7 percent of its revenue, followed by Europe (24.3 percent), rest of the world (12 percent) and India (3 percent), as on September 30, 2020. Infosys had clocked 8.5 percent year-on-year rise in revenue to Rs 24,570 crore in the September 2020 quarter.Infosys had 2,40,208 employees at the end of the said quarter. It does not provide a region-specific break-up of the headcount.Rao said that through academia partnerships with institutes like Purdue, Trinity and RISD, the company has trained a large number of employees as well, and is leveraging the training and reskilling programmes that it has built with partners.""We recently launched reskill and restart platform, which will play a crucial role in hiring local talent. We will bring a specific focus on building pathways for those that have been impacted by the economic downturn,"" he said adding that Infosys is also expanding its presence in nearshore locations like Mexico and Canada.Asked if Infosys will rethink its strategy as the approach of the president-elect on the visa issue appears to be more liberal, Rao said it is still early days to comment.""It is early days to see what the approach of the new regime is towards visa and by and large many of the things we saw during the Trump regime had bipartisan support as well.""We may see some changes from the Trump regime, but it will not go back to the old pre-Trump days,"" he added.He added that from a strategic perspective, Infosys'' approach of localisation is ""probably the right one"".""This is what we anticipated about three years back and we are seeing huge success and we have benefited from it and it is likely to continue,"" Rao said.Indian IT players are keeping a close watch on US president-elect Joe Biden''s approach and policies related to H-1B work visas that are used by a large number of Indian technology professionals. Biden is to be sworn in as the US president on January 20, 2021.In June, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Donald Trump administration had banned the entry into the US of workers in several key non-immigrant visa categories, including H-1B, until the end of the year, arguing that they eat into American jobs.Those affected include the family members of the H-1B, L-1, and certain categories of J1 visas. Later, certain exemptions in H-1B and L-1 travel bans were announced for those continuing employment with the same employer. The move that could help Indian IT professionals and those working in the healthcare sector."
243	"The idea to develop India specific 5G standard is an existential threat and will lock the country out of the global ecosystem, a senior Bharti Airtel official said on Tuesday.The official also said the development of a separate 5G standard will impact innovation.""There are sometimes talks that India must have its own 5G standard. This is an existential threat which could lock India out of the global ecosystem and slow down the pace of innovation. We could have let our citizens down if you allow that to happen,” Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal said while speaking at virtual India Mobile Congress 2020.The statement from Vittal followed a speech by RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani at the event, where he mentioned that Jio’s 5G network ""will be powered by indigenous-developed network, hardware and technology components”.Jio has sought spectrum in certain frequencies from the Department of Telecom for holding trials of the latest 5G technology.The company’s wholly-owned US-based subsidiary Radisys has already started selling some of the 5G solutions to foreign companies. Vittal said India should have an open ecosystem. He cited examples of CDMA and GSM to push his case.""CDMA was better technology, but GSM won because it was more accepted technology. More companies in the world embraced GSM. GSM won because it became part of the global ecosystem and CDMA died,” he added.He said that there is a need to create an India open ecosystem and promote applications developed for India and by India.""For this we have to come together. We have to set aside our differences and be part of one. Telcos, equipment players, device players, manufacturing companies, IT companies. Everyone can benefit as the globe of technology makes it all more productive,” Vittal said.He called for enabling a policy environment that keeps access to affordable technology.""…If we as a country can embrace global standards, create an open ecosystem for India and leverage this to reimagine our businesses by having a single and predictable policy environment, the entrepreneurial energy of India will develop digital India,” Vittal said.He had earlier said that the company will refrain from bidding for 5G spectrum if the reserve price is high.Regulator Trai has recommended a price of Rs 492 crore per Mhz for spectrum in the 3,300-3,600 Mhz band which is considered suitable for 5G services at present.Telecom operators interested in buying radiowaves for 5G services will have to shell out a minimum of Rs 9,840 crore on pan-India basis to buy spectrum in the 3,300-3,600 Mhz band as Trai has suggested that it should be put to auction in the block size of 20 MHz.Earlier also, Airtel had said that it will not bid for this spectrum at the Trai-recommended price as companies will need to shell out about Rs 50,000 crore to acquire a decent quantity of frequencies in this band."

314	Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Titan CompanyWe are increasing FY21/22/23 EPS estimates by 50%, 17% and 19.9% and rating from Hold to Accumulate. Our optimism on TTAN has been elevated by 1) faster than expected rebound in Jewellery sales (98% in 2Q) led by wedding segment and 2) improved competitive position of TTAN in post Covid scenario. TTAN has near term headwinds like 1) Cutback in discretionary spends 2) 40% higher gold prices and 3) heavy discounting by local jewellery chains, however we expect TTAN to gain market share led by 1) accelerated industry consolidation (not even marginal players but even organized players shut stores) 2) assured volumes under GHS (20-25% of sales 3) strong balance sheet 4) ability to open stores even in tiring times (14 added in 1H21) 5) franchisee based model and 6) implementation of Hall marking in 2021. Although recovering from COVID, discretionary categories like Watches, Eyewear, Fragrances and Sarees will take longer to recover. We expect full recovery to set in from festival season and now estimate YOY sales and profit growth in 2HFY21.OutlookWe estimate 47% decline in FY21 EPS to Rs9.3 but an increase to Rs23.9 and Rs 29.4 in FY22 and FY23. We believe TTAN will continue to enjoy premium valuations and value the stock at 46xFY23 EPS and arrive at a target price of Rs1352 (Rs1057 earlier@45xDec22 EPS).

ASPs surprised negatively, coming in at Rs 4.5 lakh/unit, down 5.6% YoY – pointing to some element of down-trading. EBITDA margins at 10.3% were up 80 bps YoY. Savings were realised on raw material costs front but the same was negated, to an extent, through higher other expenses. Consequent PAT was at Rs 1,372 crore, up 1% YoY. PAT was supported by lower depreciation charge and lower effective tax rate (~22%).OutlookWe introduce FY23E numbers and build sales, PAT CAGR of 2.6% & 7.2%, respectively, in FY20-23E. Margins uptick is seen being sedate, with our estimates building in ~11.2% by FY23E on the back of better operating leverage and focus on costs. Our previous concerns over volume visibility have been allayed, to an extent but the stock remains richly valued, in our view.

24	"Recent data suggests that the economy is on the path to recovery. The September quarter earnings along with management commentaries also seem to point to that as the government continues its efforts to revive demand.The equity benchmarks have been marching towards the record highs seen in January 2020. The BSE Sensex reclaimed 41,000-mark on November 5 and the Nifty50 hit 12,100, though some part of the rally is fuelled by by US elections.Both indices have gained around 60 percent from the lows of March 23, with midcap and smallcap mirroring the performance.""Overall we remain cautiously optimistic – cautious due to valuations and growth uncertainty for India, optimistic because there are some visible signs that consumption is reviving. Expanding central bank balance sheets and strong inflows into equity markets have kept the markets buoyant over the last six months, any reversal, on this may impact the overall bullish sentiment,"" Mihir Vora, Director & Chief Investment Officer at Max Life Insurance told Moneycontrol.He said the overall themes remained the same—consumption revival, exporters and Make-in-India plays.Axis Securities, too, is confident about digital, pharmaceuticals, private banks, telecom, staples, personal transportation and rural themes and also sees potential in housing in 2021.""Even as uncertainty could continue post US elections, fiscal stimulus likelihood will rise and the dollar could weaken, which will benefit the emerging markets. 2021 is likely to be a good year for the emerging markets as inflows are likely,"" the brokerage said.Given the outperformance of midcaps and smallcaps over largecaps, especially after the September quarter earnings, analysts say this is the right time to build a portfolio.Here is the list of 20 stocks that can return 13-49 percent:Brokerage: Axis SecuritiesICICI BankICICI Bank is well placed with stable NIM, low cost of funds and healthy capital adequacy. The recent capital raise has improved Tier I to 17.9 percent, which provides adequate balance sheet buffer. We believe valuations are undemanding for the stock, given the strong liability franchise and leveraging opportunities across group products. We remain positive on the stock and maintain buy with SOTP of Rs 504.Manappuram FinanceWe believe that credit costs will remain high on asset quality concerns for the non-old business. We expect cost optimisation to aid profitability. Balance sheet liquidity remains comfortable with no funding challenges. While cautious on the non-gold business, we believe gold business will support overall performance in uncertain macro conditions. We expect MGFL to maintain ROAE of around 24 percent over FY21/FY22. Gold lending is a high moat business and specialists like MGFL will continue to benefit.Can Fin HomesWhile loan growth moderation is expected along with slight asset quality deterioration on account of Covid-19, we expect the company to recover faster than its peers due to its loan mix and negligible developer exposure. Lower cost of funds should aid the company in maintaining NIMs while the loan mix profile skewed towards salaried segment will help in maintaining asset quality. We expect lower provisions and improved NIM for FY21E. We remain positive on the stock, given its loan book profile, stable liquidity position and robust CAR (25 percent) and recommend ""buy"" with a target price of Rs 515.NOCILWe expect NOCIL to register revenue/earnings CAGR of 20/24 percent respectively over FY20-23E. This growth will be driven by 1) utilisation ramp-up at Dahej; 2) relatively high entry barriers and long customer approval cycles, 3) debt-free status maintained even in challenging times and 4) likely ADD levy to support margins in the medium term. At CMP, the stock trades at an attractive 9.6x FY23 EPS, leaving enough room for an upside.Varun BeveragesWe expect VBL to register revenues/earnings CAGR of 11/29 percent, respectively, over CY19-22E. This growth will be driven by 1) consolidation in newly acquired territories, 2) distribution led market share gains, 3) cost efficiencies and margin tailwinds (cost rationalization and benign RM) should support EBITDA margin in CY20E despite weak operating leverage.CCL ProductsWe believe CCLP is well placed to deliver steady earnings over the medium term given 1) expertise in customised blends & cost-efficient business model, 2) long-standing client relationships (around 50 percent revenue contribution from brand owners) 3) largest exporter of instant coffee in India 4) presence in Vietnam, world’s largest Robusta growing country 5) capacity additions in value-added products (FDC & small packs) and 6) steadily improving branded retail business.Endurance TechnologiesWe expect Endurance Technologies to outperform the industry, given its sticky relations with OEMs, broad product basket, market leadership with market share of around 35 percent in suspensions, 25 percent in hydraulic braking system, 20 percent in disc braking system and 16 percent in transmission. New products along with tailwinds for the two-wheeler sector will support Endurance Technologies.Steel Strips WheelsBeing in an oligopoly market, SSWL commands leadership with a market share of around 55 percent in steel wheel rims and around 20 percent in alloy wheels. We expect SSWL to outperform the industry given its sticky relations with OEMs across all auto segments—2/3W, PV, CV, and tractors.Minda IndustriesWe are bullish on MNDA’s ability to comprehensively beat industry performance by 1) leveraging the broader vehicular trends of industry like EV, premiumisation, automation 2) strategic inorganic acquisition to enhance product offering and gain market share 3) maintaining balance sheet discipline and maintain optimal leverage, 4) investing In R&D to bring technological change 5) tap its deep-rooted relationship with OEMs to increase kit value. Given its success in developing import substitution products, it would be able to capture the business opportunities offered by the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ move in the auto sector. New product lines to aid margin and growth.Dr Reddy's LabsDRRD has leveraged its 100 ANDAs portfolio and launched high-value products with limited competition in the last two years. Further, commentary from the top six generic pharma players in NAG reveals pricing stability in the business. In the next two years, DRRD has a healthy pipeline to launch drugs like gRemodulin, gDexilant, gNuvaring, gCopaxone and gKuvan and potentially gVascepa that could be a gSuboxone kind opportunity. We expect revenue CAGR of 8.7 percent in constant currency for North America generic business over FY20-FY23.BioconDriven by market share gains and new launches in these high-margin biosimilars, the biologics segment is expected to post robust revenue growth (approximately in mid-twenties) over the next two-three years. Biocon management has set an ambitious target to cross $1 billion revenues for biologics over the next couple of years (from around $300 plus million in FY20). Biocon is targeting eight different biosimilars to be sold by FY22, thereby addressing a market size of $33 billion. The company is planning to deliver at least three molecules between FY23 and FY25.Tech MahindraTech Mahindra posted a robust broad-based growth in Q2FY21. We believe Tech Mahindra has a resilient business structure from a long-term perspective. We recommend ""buy"" and assign 16x P/E multiple to its FY23E earnings of Rs 62.7, which gives a target of Rs 975 per share.Bharti AirtelBharti Airtel reported solid numbers for Q2FY21, beating consensus estimates both on financial and operating parameters. The India wireless business reported robust numbers with an ARPU increase of 3 percent QoQ to Rs 162, which was significantly higher than expected. Data consumption has continued to register very strong growth. We maintain ARPU assumptions and forecast 13/17 percent CAGR for Revenue/EBIDTA over the period FY20-23. Profit growth will be even more significant considering FY20 was a loss for the company.HCL TechnologiesHCL Tech reported better than expected Q2FY21 numbers on both the margin and revenue front. Strong revenue growth in Mode 2 business (15 percent YoY) helps HCL Tech to achieve higher growth momentum in the longer term with more advance technologies.Better business matrix will help to generate higher operating business even if there is pricing pressure across verticals. We believe better business matrix and large long-term contracts make HCL Tech a promising investment as compared to its Indian peers. We believe HCLT has a resilient business structure from a long term perspective.Hindustan UnileverHindustan Unilever (HUL) delivered decent numbers for Q2FY21, both on the volume and profitability front amid headwinds on margins slump in discretionary consumption. We believe, H2FY21 will see the recovery across segments and HUL will capture decent market share backed by an increase in advertising and promotion expenses and its focus on innovation and market development (launched 100+ new SKUs in the last six months) compared to its peers.ITCITC with diversified operations across non-cyclical sectors, a resilient business model, strong-brand leadership position in cigarette business, product innovation track record & premiumisation drive is establishing itself as a FMCG major. Despite the ongoing COVID-19-related slowdown, we see recovery signs in recent months and the current valuation attractive. Besides, we expect the cigarette business to revive in the future with strict regulation from government on curbing the sale of illegal cigarettes.CiplaRespiratory drugs has seen traction in demand owing to COVID-19 and market leader like Cipla is eyeing greater attention from the investment community. The company was able to garner 65 percent market share (Q1FY21) in Proventil market with its newly launched Albuterol Sulfate. Approval for another promising ANDA, Advair Diskus of GSK (having an addressable market of $2.9 billion) is also expected soon. Cipla's domestic business is on track after disruption in trade generics.Granules IndiaGranules India’s long-term investments in backward and forward integration from APIs to FDs (Finished Dosages) is bearing fruits now as demonstrated by extraordinary last two quarters. The company has also managed to keep a check on its balance sheet by reducing gross debt from Rs 870 crore in the previous quarter to Rs 861 crore in the current quarter.Persistent SystemsPersistent Systems posted a robust Q2FY21 performance, led by large deal execution, while margin improved aided by cost optimisation and higher utilisation. The mid-sized IT firm won several large deals across technology, BFSI and medical devices verticals, providing good medium-term visibility. Wage hikes will be awarded in Q3FY21, which will be offset by revenue growth and offshore shift of large deals. There remains good scope for cross-selling services between Alliances and TSU. The new CEO appointment removes a stock overhang. We maintain buy rating, with a target price of Rs 1,415.CreditAccess GrameenPromoter holding has been reduced to 74 percent after Rs 800 crore worth of funds raised through QIP issue (allotment at Rs 707 per share) on October  8, 2020. Additionally, the board of directors approved issue of NCDs worth Rs 100 crore to strengthen its liquidity. It is a good quality stock with strong asset quality, expected regional penetration & high promoter holding. Accordingly, we assign P/ABV multiple of 3.0x to FY22E consolidated adjusted book value of Rs 281 per share to arrive at a target price of Rs 843 per share and maintain buy rating on the stock."

217	Motilal Oswal 's research report on HCL TechnologiesHCL Technologies (HCLT) delivered strong revenue growth (4.5% QoQ CC) on the back of broad-based recovery across geographies, verticals, and services. EBIT margin expansion (+110bp QoQ), driven by operating leverage, was better than expected.

The latter being underpinned by low impeding and susceptible flow (small SC-order slippage pool and SMA-2 + robust customer asset mix with only 6% coming from unsecured products) and management commentary on current Covid buffer (62 bps of adv.) being adequate to address potential stress. We estimate the stand-alone bank to deliver 20-22% earnings CAGR on a 6-7% loan CAGR over FY20-22 because of expansion in core PPOP margin.OutlookWe see no deterioration in RoA for the current year despite higher provisions and expect profitability to improve to life-time high in FY22.

Something the bank said was unexpected outage at one of its data centres.Customers said transactions through HDFC's credit/debit cards, internet banking, UPI, IMPS, and other modes of payment were failing, due to which they could not proceed with their banking-related services.

It added that the same had been communicated to the banking regulator.>> Before this, on October 1, 2019, customers of the bank reported issues they were facing while trying to log into the net banking facility.RBI action>> After the outage in December, RBI deputy governor MK Jain had said the regulator had taken into account the outage and deployed a team of experts to ""investigate the matter"" without naming the bank.""Our team has gone to really identify the reasons and find out what we can give them (HDFC Bank) as a direction,"" Jain told reporters at the customary post-policy presser on December 5, 2019.While replying to a question on whether the RBI is considering a framework for penalising such banks, Jain did not name HDFC Bank, but did say that the RBI is aware of the problem, while explaining that technical glitches had resulted in online banking getting impacted on December 2."

188	"Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank is expected to see around 20 percent year-on-year decline in its Q2 FY21 profit due to a potential spike in provisions.The growth in net interest income could also slow down to around 12 percent year-on-year with moderate loan growth and a slight contraction in net interest margin for the quarter ended September 2020.The pre-provision in operating profit (PPoP) growth is also expected to moderate to little over 10 percent YoY due to slow growth in net interest income and other income, supported by controlled operating expenses.""We expect net interest margin to dip, on account of asset side re-pricing and a lower cost-to-deposit ratio.

We expect NII growth of 12.6 percent YoY (up 1 percent QoQ),"" said HDFC Securities.""With controlled operating expenses growth PPoP is expected to grow at 10.5 percent YoY and 5.6 percent QoQ.

The brokerage sees 20 percent decline profit but expects 12.6 percent growth in NII and 10.1 percent in PPoP.Key things to watch out for would be comments on growth and overall stress, additional provisions towards COVID-19/ increase in PCR and performance of subsidiaries.The stock has not seen major movement during the September quarter and financial year 2020-21, falling 6.8 percent and rising 6.7 percent respectively, though it gained 26 percent from March lows.
