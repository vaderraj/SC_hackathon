173	1	a	Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITCITC PAT beat has been led by better than expected performance in Cigarettes, Agri and Paperboard business and 44% growth in other income. FMCG story remains intact with 34% sales growth and 170bps margin expansion led by segments like Atta, Biscuits, Noodles, Dairy and Hygiene products. Cigarette business is expected to report improved nos as June exit sale show recovery close to Pre Covid sales. Hotels business is expected to remain under significant pressure in near term with poor chance of being in black for next 1-2 quarters. We believe ITC would be one of the key beneficiary of an uptick in consumer demand and is inching towards double digit EBIDTA margins in FMCG business over next 2-3 years. ITC trades at 14.0x Sept22 EPS, ~60% discount to our coverage universe with 5% dividend yield (80% payout) and 7.1% PBT CAGR over FY20-23.OutlookMaintain BUY with target price of Rs262 on SOTP (valuing cigarette business at 15xSept EPS, 58% of SOTP value).

While large part of the operating improvement will taper in ensuing quarters, management’s commentary on 2 aspects (1) Some portion of costs savings in India might be permanent in nature – digital product launches and (2) some products in the specialty segment to achieve break-even by FY22; could drive operating leverage by ~100-150bps going ahead.OutlookWe believe the risk reward is favorable given the strong FCF generation of US$365mn over FY20-22E and FCF/EBITDA at ~60%.

230	1	a	Maruti Suzuki became the only carmaker in the top five category to register a drop in sales in November 2020. This came on the back of two consecutive months of robust double-digit growths. Sales of the Alto and Swift maker fell by 2.4 percent during November while the industry grew by 9 percent during the same month.So was it demand fatigue, fierce competition or a combination of both behind the fall, which has spooked market watchers? None, as per a company official. The real reason behind the fall was due to the record low factory inventory and production shortages.Speaking to Moneycontrol, Shashank Srivastava, executive director, marketing and sales, Maruti Suzuki India, said: “In November, our opening stock was very low. There was very little of it because we had record dispatches in October.”In October 2020, Maruti Suzuki dispatched around 166,000 units, which was its highest-ever in a month. But in November, the company recorded dispatches of 135,775 units as against 139,133 units recorded in the same month in 2019.“What we could dispatch in November was only what we were able to produce in November. The number of working days in our factories in November were much lesser. Still, we worked at full capacity, and produced 137,000 units for the domestic market (including the light truck Super Carry) and that’s what we dispatched,” added Srivastava. Supply chain (auto parts availability) is still an issue in the auto industry. Plus, Diwali holidays also hit factory output.Maruti's drop in November sales was the first since June, fuelling speculations that India’s consumer demand revival was short-lived and largely dependent on pent-up demand created due to the lockdown. This theory was amplified when Maruti’s mini segment comprising Alto and S-Presso recorded a fall of 15 percent in volumes during November. Following the easing of the lockdown restrictions, buyers have preferred pocket-friendly car models such as those from the mini segment to avoid taking public transport.The retail quotientWhile wholesales (company to dealers) did take a knock in November, retail (dealer to consumer) volumes remained upbeat, growing by 69 percent compared to the same month last year, claimed Srivastava.“Maruti Suzuki’s market share in the retail segment is still more than 50 percent and it has remained like that, right from the start of the year. It was 45 percent in November last year. We grew our retails by 69 percent compared to last year’s November. We sold 167,500 in November this year compared to 99,500 last year,” added Srivastava.Retail volumes remained high in November despite the discounts hitting a yearly low. At an estimated Rs 17,500, the average discount offered on a Maruti Suzuki car during November was the lowest since the start of the financial year. The highest discount was offered during the June quarter of Rs 25,000 per car at the wholesale level.“As the stocks are lower right now, one would see lower discount figures in December as it was in November. December would be even lower than November,” added Srivastava.How did Maruti’s rivals fare?Hyundai Motor India, which, like Maruti Suzuki, is also running its plants at full capacity, recorded a 9 percent growth in wholesale volumes in November. Tata Motors managed to keep up with its monthly production rate of November on par with the last few months. The Mumbai-based company doubled November wholesales compared to last year’s November.

""You have to exponentially speed up,"" he said.Red-tape and multiple permissions needed for exploring and producing oil and gas have in the past led to several slippages in the committed timelines.""Tell us, if you need more help,"" Pradhan said asking explorers to give suggestions on improving the regulatory environment. ""Business as usual cannot work.""The minister also wanted the data repository set up by his ministry''s upstream nodal agency, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), to be remodelled on lines of the National Geoscience Data Repository (NGDR) of the mines ministry.He wanted the data repository, which houses geological data of Indian sedimentary basins, to become an independent profit centre.The NGDR is a public-private initiative for all non-coal and non-fuel resources.The government had offered 11 blocks for exploration and production of oil and gas in OLAP-V.A total of 12 bids, including seven bids by ONGC and four by OIL, were received for the 11 blocks on offer at the close of bidding on June 30. Invenire Petrodyne Ltd was the only private bidder for one block.While ONGC was the sole bidder for six blocks, OIL was the lone bidder in all the four blocks it bid for.ONGC won all six blocks where it was the sole bidder and also the one block where Invenire Petrodyne had bid.The previous bid round, OALP-IV, too had seen just eight bids coming in for seven blocks on offer. ONGC had walked away with all the seven oil and gas blocks on offer.Prior to OALP-V, the government had awarded 94 blocks in four OALP bid rounds since 2017.

25	0	a	The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed its first chargesheet on Wednesday in the ICICI Bank-Videocon loan case, involving Deepak Kochhar, businessman and husband of ICICI Bank’s former CEO Chanda Kochhar, and Videocon promoter Venugopal Dhoot.The ED has filed the chargesheet against 10 entities and three individuals. Videocon International Electronics Ltd (VIEL), Videocon Industries Ltd, Nu Power Renewables Ltd, Supreme Energy Pvt Ltd, Venugopal Dhoot, and Deepak and Chanda Kochhar are among them.Deepak Kochhar, who is in the judicial custody of ED now, may move court for bail after this chargesheet.What is the case?The ED’s probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the ICICI Bank-Videocon loan case pertains to irregularities in the sanctioning of six loans worth Rs 1,875 crore by ICICI Bank to five firms of the Videocon Group between June 2009 and October 2011.The bank had, on August 26, 2009, sanctioned a Rupee Term Loan of Rs 300 crore to VIEL in alleged contravention of the policy of the sanctioning committee, sources said.On September 7, 2009, the loan was disbursed to VIEL, which it transferred to a group firm, Videocon Industries Limited (VIL), for financing the latter’s capital expenditure requirements.The next day, on September 8, in contravention of the terms of the loan sanctioned, VIL allegedly transferred Rs 64 crore through Supreme Energy, out of the loan proceeds, to Nupower Renewables, whose then managing director and CEO was Deepak Kochhar.It was alleged that the transfer was part of a ‘quid pro quo’ transaction between Chanda Kochhar and the Videocon Group via her husband’s firm. Deepak and Chanda were questioned by the ED in the past and they had, along with the other case accused, denied all allegations. VIEL, SEPL, VIL, NRL, Deepak, Chanda and Videocon Group’s Managing Director VN Dhoot were cited as accused in the case by ED.ED arrests Deepak KochharOn September 8, the agency arrested Deepak Kochhar. ED had registered its case under the provisions of PMLA on the basis of a case registered by the CBI in January 2019 for cheating, conspiracy and misconduct by public servants under the Indian Penal Code and Prevention of Corruption Act.The CBI had registered its case on the basis of the findings of the agency’s year-long probe as part of its preliminary enquiry, a precursor to the registration of a regular case, which commenced in December 2017.ED investigation showed that the residential property of Chanda Kochhar, worth Rs 5.25 crore in Mumbai, was bought in 1996 by Credential Finance Ltd, in which Videocon was having a substantial interest, along with Deepak and Chanda Kochhar. CFL defaulted the loan worth of Rs 4.7 crore, which it took from Videocon.Subsequently, the ownership transferred to Quality Techno Advisors Pvt Ltd, and then its whole shareholding was acquired by Quality Advisors, a family trust of Deepak Kochhar, for just Rs 11 lakh.

HUVR results beat expectations driven by double digit growth in Health, Nutrition and Hygiene and better than expected recovery in Personal care. HUL remains confident of gaining market share across categories and has cut prices of Detergents and absorbed part of input cost increase in Tea. Although color cosmetics and Deo’s will see a delayed recovery, lack of inventory push will enable strong 3Q relative to last year. GSK integration is in progress and any meaningful gains in sales growth will accrue from 4Q only. Near term margin outlook remains challenging given higher prices of Palmoil and Tea and bottomed out ad- spends. We remain structurally positive on HUL given its strategy around emerging categories, increasing distribution, WIMI, digital market and strength in Supply chain. We estimate HUL to post EBIDTA CAGR of 15.9% over FY20-23 led by 200bps margin expansion.OutlookWe however cut EPS estimates by 2-4% as we increase dividend payout to 95% and assume lower interest on surplus funds.

A 970bps decline in margin in the cigarette business indicates that the product mix was unfavorable and economy brand contribution must have increased during the quarter. Significant increase in duty has resulted in widening of price gap between ITC and smuggled cigarettes. We believe that this would continue to pressurize volume growth even after lockdown re-opens. FMCG business exhibited satisfactory performance with 10% revenue increase and 120bps margin expansion.

Retail revenue in June quarter 2019 was at Rs 38,216 crore and EBITDA at Rs 2,060 crore.RIL said EBITDA was positive and resilient despite the limitations in the quarter, with cost management initiatives leading to fixed cost savings, which helped cushion the impact of lower profits from lower sales.Despite gross margin expansion and cost savings, EBITDA margin was impacted by fixed costs and adverse mix (with the most profitable Fashion & Lifestyle categories being hit the hardest), coming in at 3.8 percent during the quarter against 6.0 percent during the corresponding period of the previous year, it added.Reliance said the quarter saw 21 percent growth year-on-year across the operational businesses of Grocery and Connectivity, while Consumer Electronics and Fashion and Lifestyle businesses were hit particularly hard by the cessation of activity during the lockdown period, as stores were closed for the most part of the quarter.On the petrochemicals front, Reliance said revenue for Q1FY21 declined by 33 percent YoY to Rs 25,192 crore primarily due to lower price realizations with disruptions in local and regional markets amid COVID-19 outbreak.EBITDA for the quarter declined 49.7 percent YoY to Rs 4,430 crore. ""Weak domestic demand and higher share of exports impacted margins as compared to regional benchmarks. The impact of lower realization was partially offset by cost optimization and integration benefits,"" company said.Q1 was a very challenging quarter as due to lockdown, domestic industry and supply chains virtually came to a halt as both producers and converters shut down plants across India, it added.In case of refining and marketing business, Reliance said revenues for June quarter 2020 declined by 54.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 46,642 crore due to lower crude oil price and lower throughput.Brent crude price averaged at $29.2 a barrel during the quarter versus $68.8 a barrel in Q1FY20, down 57.6 percent YoY.Regional Benchmark Singapore Complex Margins turned negative for the first time in 2 decades and averaged at $-0.9 a barrel.Reliance said its gross refining margins at $6.3 a barrel was impacted by lower product cracks and narrower light-heavy crude differential. However, it maintained a significant premium of $7.2 a barrel over regional benchmark margin.Refining and marketing EBITDA declined to Rs 3,818 crore (down 25.8 percent YoY) due to weak margin environment and lower throughput, RIL said, adding refining segment profitability was sustained through optimized crude procurement, relatively higher utilization, cost management and agile product placement.RIL is now one of the 50 most valued companies globally with a market capitalisation of Rs 13.92 lakh crore at its record high price.Promoters' shareholding stood at 50.37 percent in the June quarter up from 50.07 percent in the March quarter, while foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) raised their stake to 24.72 percent from 24.05 percent in the same period.Find all earnings related news here(This is a developing story.

Cognizant of morat slippages (current morat 8%) and status quo on bureau data, BAF pared down FY21 AUM growth guidance to 6-7% as against 10-12% earlier. Said that, NPA improvement to 1.34% (despite SC order) vs PLe of 2.2%, fee income growth at 4.4%QoQ led by steady cross sell franchise (23mn) and better opex management (stable opex to NII at 28%) aided PPoP growth (15%YoY/0.3%QoQ).

USD revenue was up 2.9% QoQ CC vs. TCS/INFY/WIPRO/HCLT performance of +4.8/+4.0/+2.0/+4.5% QoQ CC respectively. Telecom was up 3.2% QoQ (in line with our estimate), but Enterprise (+6.0% QoQ) performed better than expected. Growth was led by Technology & Media (+14.1% QoQ), BFSI and Retail bounced back strongly, while manufacturing was stable. BPM recovered strongly (+31.1% QoQ) due to market share gains and reversal in supply-side factors. Net-new TCV improved to USD 421mn, and the pipeline continues to remain strong. The 5G related spend has shifted to FY22E, but TechM is well-poised to benefit from this spend. Telecom recovery will be gradual (led by 5G), but Enterprise will drive growth, supported by a revival in Manufacturing and Retail verticals. Margin expansion of +413bps QoQ was better than expected (14.2% vs. the estimate of 11.3%), led by offshoring, higher utilisation, lower sub-con and visa fees.OutlookTechM aims to expand the margin to 15%, but it will still have the lowest margin in Tier-1 IT.

416	1	a	Bajaj Auto and partner KTM have restarted talks on transferring the 48 percent stake held by the Indian company in the Austrian bike maker back to its holding entity.Bajaj Auto’s 48 percent equity, along with the 51.7 percent stake held by Pierer Mobility AG, make up the shareholding of KTM AG, the legal entity that is responsible for making products under its own brand, Husqvarna and GasGas brands.KTM Group and Bajaj Auto are holding discussions to transfer the 48 percent stake of Bajaj Auto in KTM AG to the listed company Pierer Mobility AG. The discussions are being held between Bajaj Auto International Holding BV, the Netherlands-based subsidiary, and Pierer Industrie AG, the parent company of Pierer Mobility AG.Although finer details of the proposed realignment of the partnership has not been shared by either companies, sources say that this would kick-start a new chapter in the 13-year-old partnership that has so far seen joint design and development of products, common use of manufacturing facility, overseas distribution pact and joint marketing and sales.The two companies had held the same discussions in March 2019, with the transaction decision targeted to be made in the second quarter of the same year. But less than three months later, both companies aborted the plan for unspecified reasons.“Pierer Mobility AG was informed by Pierer Industrie AG and Bajaj that they have restarted discussions on assessing the possibility of transferring Bajaj's 48 percent stake in KTM AG to Pierer Mobility AG, with the Pierer Group continuing to retain the controlling majority over Pierer Mobility AG”, a statement from Pierer Mobility AG said.What is different this time is the proposal to make PTW Holding AG, a newly formed entity by KTM, the 60-percent stake holder in Pierer Mobility AG. This translates to transferring the said 60 percent stake from Pierer Industrie AG to PTW Holding.“Pierer Industrie AG and Bajaj will now evaluate the proposal in detail,” the statement further added.The authorised capital enables a capital increase of up to 50 percent of the existing share capital. After the transaction, the stake of Pierer Mobility AG in KTM AG will increase from the current 51.7 percent to approximately 99.7 percent, the statement added.KTM increases 2020 forecastThe announcement of restarting discussions of stake transfer comes less than two months after the Austrian bike maker increased the forecast for the second half of 2020, following sustained high demand for all brands including e-bikes.The management board of Pierer Mobility AG decided to increase the sales forecast published at the end of August 2020 for the second half of 2020 to over € 850 million (previously € 800 million). Around 64 percent of KTM’s revenues come from Europe, followed by North America, and Mexico with 17 percent.Riding on BajajThe partnership with Bajaj Auto made the Austrian company the world's biggest premium bike manufacturer, beating US heavyweight Harley-Davidson (in volumes) in 2018 and 2019.Of the 90,331 motorcycles sold in the first half of 2020, 22 percent was manufactured and sold by Bajaj Auto in India and Indonesia. In return, Bajaj has benefited from technology sharing and becoming the sole manufacturer of KTM and Husqvarna bikes outside of Europe, with exports reaching the US, Japan and South Asia.From worldwide volumes of 280,099 units clocked in 2019, KTM is expecting to sell around 400,000 two-wheelers in 2022. This will include nearly doubling of production at Bajaj Auto’s Chakan, Pune-based plant to 200,000 units, from around 108,000 units at present. This will include a mix of joint products (of KTM and Husqvarna bands) and KTM products distributed by Bajaj on a licence fee model.The two companies have also started work on electric two-wheelers. The first of such e-bikes having power range between 3 and 10 kW (48 volts) will roll off the Chakan production line. The platform will support various product variants under the brand of both the partners.KTM is developing a 4kW electric scooter under the Husqvarna brand whose market launch is expected to take place in 2021. This will be followed by the launch of Husqvarna E-Pilen, a 4kW/10kW, fully electric motorcycle with modular battery system. The Husqvarna E-Pilen is expected to be launch-ready in 2022.

Foods segment saw strong 19% growth supported by price hike in tea segment. Home care segment declined 1.6% with 2.3% price cuts in fabric wash. The recovery in the business was led by complete normalisation of supply chain & strong demand in health, hygiene & nutrition space. However, demand for discretionary & out of home products has still remained dismal. The health, hygiene & nutrition products that constitute 80% of sales witnessed growth of 10% whereas discretionary & out of home consumption products, which constitute 20%of sales saw a decline of 25%. Gross margin declined 145 bps largely on account of a sharp 70% increase in tea prices. Though the company has taken price hikes, it is not sufficient to pass on the entire cost increase. With 221 bps lower advertisement spends, HUL was able to maintain its operating margins at 25.1% (27 bps up). Net profit increased 8.7% to Rs 2009 crore. The slower growth in profitability is largely due to lower tax in base quarter.OutlookWe believe H2FY21E would witness strong growth across segments with complete demand recovery in discretionary portfolio as well. The company has been able to leverage strong brands in hygiene (Lifebuoy, Domex, Vim, Surf Excel) space to drive growth. We believe the company would continue to witness strong double digit growth in the health, hygiene & nutrition space. Further, margins improvement with consolidation of nutrition brands would drive earnings.

It would incur total capital outlay of Rs54.8bn with attractive capex cost of USD58/t, significantly below standard cost of USD75-80/t. This expansion is over and above the ongoing expansion of 6.7mnt. Nearly 52% of its new capacity would come in East region, which is already facing sharp surge in supplies. Intense competition pushed margins to new lows of Rs850-900/t in the region. However, lower margins were compensated by strong volume growth. We believe that strong fundamentals of the region and near bottomed out margins augur well for the expansion with aided advantage of low capex cost and superior logistics. Rest of the expansion is dedicated in attractive markets of North and Central India.

130	1	a	Bengaluru-based IT major Infosys last week launched a solution for Covid-19 vaccine management. Earlier, US-based Accenture, too, had launched a similar solution to support vaccination programmes and vaccine-distribution activities.So, what have IT services firms to gain from the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines? Quite a bit. The world is staring at a vaccination drive for billions of people. Many countries, including India, are allocating budgets and drawing up plans to make this rollout as smooth as possible.All these are being done on a scale never seen before and in a very short time. This presents a huge business opportunity not just for biotech firms, pharmaceuticals or logistics players but also for tech firms.Where does the opportunity lie?The opportunities for tech firms are in two key areas: patient management and cold chain monitoring.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Karthikeyan Natarajan, COO of Hyderabad-based IT Services firm Cyient, has some insights on the potential. Cyient is looking to tap into opportunities in vaccine management, such as cold chain monitoring.Natarajan explained that the job is not done just about administration of vaccines. “Say (for instance) 10 million vaccines are administered in Hyderabad or Mumbai. How do you really know that it has gone well and it has not reacted,” he asked.Follow Moneycontrol's COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker here.“So, it is not so much about saying that I am done with the injection; if you are a vaccine producer, you have to map the whole lifecycle,” he added.“You need to use a lot of digital tools from a patient-management standpoint before administration, during and post,” he added.Managing cold chainsPatient management is just one aspect. The other is managing cold chains. Pfizer’s vaccine, which has shown more than 95 percent efficacy in phase-3 trials, needs to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius. Moderna’s vaccine would need -20 degrees Celsius storage and AstraZeneca needs to be refrigerated at 2-8 degrees.These cold-storage chains need to be managed. For instance, it would be important to monitor how soon these vaccines need to be administered and also check for spoilage. According to a Scientific American report, once Pfizer’s vaccine is transferred to a refrigerator, it has to be administered within five days. Also, during distribution, there could be chances of vaccines being spoilt. According to the report, this spoilage could be anywhere between 5-20 percent.The Internet of things can be used to monitor the temperature and keep a check on vaccine vials “so that you know which ones got exposed to higher temperatures for a longer duration and segregate them”, he explained.The scale at which this needs to be managed is huge and would require technological intervention, where tech services firms come into play.Role of tech services in vaccine managementA case in point is the announcement by the Australian State of Victoria, which recently announced a tender for a Covid-19 vaccine management solution. The State said it is looking to select a private contractor who can deliver cloud-based software to manage the entire process of the vaccine rollout.Infosys and Accenture have jumped into the fray to develop solutions.Infosys’ vaccine management solution, developed by Simplus (which it acquired recently), and hosted on the Salesforce cloud, offers solutions for individuals and healthcare service providers. While individuals can use the platform to find solutions and schedule appointments, providers can use it to maintain inventory, log vaccine administration details and document adverse effects.Accenture’s solution, built on the Salesforce platform, includes contract tracing and managing the supply chain. It uses analytics to allocate vaccine supply and also monitor the dosage regime.How big an opportunity is there?There is a lot riding for firms involved in the vaccine drive. The cost of slipups is huge and their reputation could take a massive hit, pointed out analysts, explaining why the role tech service providers play would be important. However, the opportunity is tough to quantify, as vaccine management alone would not result in substantial revenue, say analysts and executives.Pareekh Jain, founder, Pareekh Consulting, agreed that the vaccine drive is unlikely to bring in substantial revenue for IT services firms. But, he added, it allows companies to expand their footprint into healthcare.Jain explained that so far, IT firms; exposure to core pharmaceutical operations is small as they use their in-house team. However the sheer scale of operations amid Covid-19 can give them an entry point to move beyond legacy operations by leveraging their data analytics and AI solutions to gain a bigger market, he added.In the wake of Covid-19, healthcare was one of the few sectors that grew for IT services firms. The last six months saw huge investments coming into pharmaceuticals, medical devices and predictive healthcare, some of which are likely to stay. This could also provide more opportunities.
72	1	a	Motilal Oswal 's research report on ONGCONGC’s 4QFY20 oil and gas sales were 3%/8% higher than estimate while net realization was 3% lower than estimate. This resulted in marginal beat on revenue. Higher other expenditure and COVID-19 led impairment resulted in a huge loss on the bottom line for the company during the quarter. ONGC did not see any reduction in crude oil demand starting 1st Apr’20. However, gas production saw modest decline of 9% during the lockdown, but has now been restored to normal pre-COVID levels. Global lockdowns on account of COVID-19 led to huge demand destruction, which saw crude oil prices sink to historic lows. With lifting of the lockdowns across the world, demand is again seeing an uptick. On the supply side, production cuts, both intentional (OPEC++) and unintentional (due to poor economies/bankruptcies), appear to be putting upward pressure on oil prices. ONGC is also expected to grow its gas production by ~12%/26% to 27.9bcm/35.2bcm in FY21/FY22E. While no oil production growth is expected, ONGC’s efforts to arrest decline from age-old fields (accounting for 60–70% of the total oil production) is commendable. Maintain Buy.OutlookONGC is trading at 3.3x FY22E EV/EBITDA and 4.3x FY22E P/E. We value the company at 10x FY22E adj.

However, APAT fell by ~36%, courtesy substantially lower-than-anticipated other income.OutlookOur REDUCE recommendation on ONGC with a price target of INR 78 is premised on (1) muted crude oil and gas realisations and (2) lack of production growth for oil. Despite production cuts from OPEC and non-OPEC countries, we expect oil prices to remain at USD 36/41 per barrel in FY21/22E vs. USD 63/bbl in FY20, given the weak global macros.

164	0	a	Diversified business conglomerate ITC's nearly 20 percent drop in profits in second quarter-ended September 30, 2020 may well be masking a strategic shift towards consistently strengthening its fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) business, a segment that has otherwise remained largely ignored among investors and analysts.The company's net profit during the quarter fell to Rs 3,232.4 crore during the quarter, compared to Rs 4,023.1 crore in the same period last year, meeting street estimates.Revenue from the FMCG and 'Others' segment, however, clocked a 18.4 percent growth on a comparable basis (excluding lifestyle retailing business for which restructuring is underway, as also the education and stationery products business that has been seriously impacted by the closure of educational institutions).A disaggregated analysis points towards a strategic tilt towards FMCG in recent years.In the current financial year during the quarter-ended September 30, 2020, EBITDA for the FMCG segment grew 66 percent, while EBITDA margins for the segment expanded 300 basis points to 9.7 percent.In the first half of the year, it launched over 70 new products in what appears to be part of an ambitious expansion plan identifying the FMCG segment as the company's main growth driver, with focus on new products, bold acquisitions and the high-octane marketing.In May, it announced the decision to acquire Kolkata-based spice maker Sunrise Foods Pvt. Ltd (SFPL), seen as part of a wider strategy to fortify its position in the country's highly competitive FMCG market that is dominated by large corporations such as Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) and several local players in diverse regional geographies.The earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortisation (EBITDA) of the new FMCG businesses has more than doubled in three years— growing from from Rs 456 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 914 crores in 2019-20.Over an eight-year period, segment EBIDTA for the FMCG businesses has multiplied from Rs 44 crore in 2012-13, a year before current Chairman Sanjiv Puri was elevated to president of the company’s FMCG business, to Rs 914 crore in 2019-20, galloping at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 54 percent.These may well be pointers for analysts and investors on what could be coming, particularly in the foods business with brands such as Aashirvaad (Rs 6,000 crore), Sunfeast (Rs 4,000 crore), Bingo (Rs 2,700 crore) and YiPPee (Rs 1,300 crore), achieving significant value and scale.The restructuring of the lifestyle retailing business with the sale of the John Players brand are all measures to improve profitability of the FMCG segment.There also appears to be a tactical shift in marketing initiatives with considerable focus on engagements with properties such as IPL, fitness and hygiene through Sunfeast, Bingo and Savlon.
320	1	a	Motilal Oswal 's research report on Titan CompanyTitan’s (TTAN) 1QFY21 results were broadly in line with estimates. Gold volumes declined by 81% during the quarter. However, decent recovery was seen in Jun’20 with Tanishq’s like-to-like growth declining 18% YoY. The recovery prospects in the jewelry segment (over 80% of sales) appear brighter with good demand in Jul’20 (101% of sales in Jul’19, albeit aided by weak base and significant activation in Jul’20) and first week of Aug’20 as well. However, recovery in watches/eyewear is tracking slower than jewelry. Another impact of ineffective hedges on margins in 2QFY21 as well is expected. However, we believe there is a possibility that recovery in the jewelry business may take place in 3QFY21, instead of 4QFY21 as guided by management. However, given the volatile demand and COVID environment, we prefer to be conservative and are assuming recovery in 4QFY21.OutlookWe have upgraded the stock to Buy in our Annual Report analysis note last week.

Even including the NPAs under standstill, gross NPA ratio would have declined QoQ by 20 bps to 2.3% led by higher recoveries/write-offs and limited slippages. Provision reserves improved materially with PCR raised to 77% (67% in 1QFY21) and standard COVID related provisions almost doubled to Rs21bn or 1.1% of loans.OutlookWe upgrade earnings estimates by 28/25% for FY21E/22E driven by better operational metrics for FY21/22E and moderation in credit costs for FY22E, revising our recommendation to ACCUMULATE from SELL with a TP of Rs670, valuing the bank at 1x Sep-22E P/ABV.

FMCG showed strong momentum as the company saw a comparable growth of 12% YoY, with 34% YoY growth in staples, convenience foods and health & hygiene (75% of the portfolio). The growth was led by packaged foods (biscuits, atta, and noodles) and hygiene products.

91	0	a	After the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) temporarily stopped launch of all new digital products of HDFC Bank, its new CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan on December 3 said the bank will comply with the RBI regulations and will wait for the regulator’s clearance before launching new products.“We had two outages, one in November 2018 and second in December 2019. We have taken help of external expertise, understood what needs to be done further and have substantially implemented the inputs to strengthen our IT infrastructure and systems,” Jagdishan said in a letter to customers.“Unexpectedly another incident happened on November 21,2020, and the primary reason for the same is the power outage in our primary data centre. We are working on war footing to strengthen this area also now,” Jagdishan said.Jagdishan assured customers that there is no reason to worry. “You can continue to transact with the bank without any concern,” he said.Jagdishan apologised for the digital outage to customers. “We realize that as our valued customer, you expect us to maintain a very high standard of service quality and experience. And sometimes, we have not been able to live up to your expectations. For that, please accept our sincere apologies,” the CEO said in the letter.The RBI asked HDFC Bank to temporarily halt sourcing new credit cards and stop the launch of its digital business-generating activities planned under Digital 2.0 and other proposed business generating IT applications.The RBI issued the order dated December 2, 2020, to HDFC Bank.The central bank on November 23 had sought an explanation from HDFC Bank after its digital services faced disruptions on the evening of November 21 till November 22 morning - for over 12 hours.The order also states that HDFC Bank’s board must examine the lapses and fix accountability.“The above measures shall be considered for lifting (the restrictions) upon satisfactory compliance with the major critical observations as identified by the RBI,” it added.New launches after RBI’s clearanceJagdishan said the bank will now launch its digital initiatives after getting the RBI’s approvals.“Some of our strategic digital initiatives to improve the front-end digital experience, improve digital origination, straight through processing, next generation of mobile and internet banking, API-based banking on the edge etc would now be readied and launched post the approval and clearance from the regulator,” the CEO said in the letter.Further, the bank will work with experts and the regulator to fortify the identified areas for improvement. “Internally, we are looking at this as an opportunity to further improve ourselves and emerge stronger,” Jagdishan said.Banks are under immense pressure because of the competition to come up with new digital banking products, often without proper testing and leading to such failures, said senior bankers. “There is intense competition from industry and new players such as payments banks to keep introducing new products. In their anxiety to remain at the top, banks often come with digital banking products that are not fully tested. Banks need to be careful to make sure they have enough technology capabilities to back such products,” said Naresh Malhotra, a senior banking consultant.To be fair, technical glitches aren’t limited to HDFC Bank alone. Other banks too have been facing problems on the technical side, with the latest instance reported on State Bank of India’s (SBI's) mobile banking application, YONO, in the last two days with customers complaining on Twitter that they are unable to login to the application following an error. This issue has not been resolved yet.

However, lower other expenditure led to an EBITDA beat during the quarter. Offtake of crude oil by refineries from ONGC was not affected. However, there was a reduction in gas production due to less off-take by some customers, which has now been restored to normal levels. Production guidance in FY21 for oil stood at ~22.7mmt and for gas at ~24.9bcm. -OPEC+ managed production cuts well (in line with demand), as various economies globally came out of the lockdowns. Thus, crude oil prices hovered around ~USD45/bbl over the last two months. Starting Aug’20, OPEC+ also eased production cuts by 2mnbopd (to 7.7mnbopd). Global demand is expected to reach ~97% of pre-COVID levels in the next quarter (Oct-Dec’20). We have built in crude oil price forecast of ~USD45/bbl for 2HFY21 and we expect prices to remain stable around current levels in the medium term. ONGC has guided that KG basin will see some delay in production as many vendors have enforced force majeure. Despite domestic gas price ceiling declining, KG basin's production would not be impacted. Despite the delay, ONGC is expected to grow its gas production in FY22E, with efforts to arrest the decline in oil production from age-old fields (accounting for 60-70% of the total oil production).

98	1	a	"The September quarter earnings show that most banking players, especially the larger ones, held up well despite the coronavirus outbreak but experts say the sector is not completely out of woods yet.Most large private banks reported improved net profits for the second quarter and a modest increase in bad loans, experts said.Top private-sector lenders such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank posted a strong sequential improvement in their profits. They also reported sequential improvement in their gross non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio.The impact of staggered roll back of lockdown restrictions, or “Unlocking”, and resumption of economic activities is visible in the banks’ quarterly results.The opening up of the economy also led to an improvement in loan repayment and a major reduction in the moratorium book but it may be too early to celebrate.Looming uncertaintyA clear picture of how COVID-19 hit the banking sector will emerge only after some quarters once the Reserve Bank of India's support wounds up.According to experts, the challenges for the sector range from an increase in slippages from moratorium books, restructuring the percentage of the loan book to quality growth.Devang Mehta, Head – Equity Advisory, Centrum Wealth Management, said the actual picture of the COVID blow to banks will only emerge over the next couple of quarters, as special dispensations provided by the RBI start to wind down.The gross NPA numbers do not show the full picture of stressed accounts for private banks, he said. It is, however, important to remember that these banks have been providing aggressively during the first six months of this financial year.Nirali Shah, Senior Research Analyst, Samco Securities has a similar view.""Prima facie, it appears that the banking sector managed to tide through one more quarter amid the pandemic with healthy profitability and a modest increase in bad loans. But, the actual pain could emerge only after a few quarters when the special dispensations provided by the RBI start to dwindle,"" Shah said.Shah sees a number of challenges.""The top challenge is reporting of NPLs. Even though most banks have reported sequential improvement in their asset quality, the truth is that the reported NPAs may not have captured all the stress on the bank’s balance sheet. In fact, a proforma number has been reported as the apex court has asked lenders not to classify any new account as NPA after August 31, 2020. This will very well push the NPAs to a future date, causing banks to delay their provision requirement,"" Shah said.Another challenge lies in the amounts reported as restructured loans, which are extremely small to date, he said. The true proportions of restructuring will emerge in the quarters ending December and March.“Collection efficiency reported by banks is still running below their pre-COVID-19 levels, especially on the unsecured side which will be a key measure to watch out for going forward,” said Shah. The road ahead is challenging and a clear picture will be visible only in the quarters to come, he added.As per the RBI’s June 2020 financial stability report, the bad loan rate is expected to climb to 14.2 percent in a severe stress scenario and 12.5 percent in a baseline scenario as of March 2021, which is a bit alarming. Due to standstill benefits banks didn’t recognise further slippages in Q2FY21 but in the next two-three quarters, NPAs are expected to rise.The improvement in collection efficiency after the end of the moratorium on August 31 is positive.September,” Jehan Bhadha, Assistant Vice President - Equity Research at Nirmal Bang said.This figure is expected to improve further by the December quarter. With the encouraging collections, banks have started to accelerate disbursement growth which has reached pre- COVID levels, Bhadha said.Should you avoid the sector?The valuation of some of the banking stocks is cheap at this juncture while the outlook of some has improved. So, one can bet on select players from the sector.Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said the banking sector is a value buy, given the inexpensive valuation and improved outlook in the long-term.Valuation wise, the Nifty Bank is trading at a 1-year forward P/B of 1.7 times compared to it the last 3 year average of 2.3 times, he said.The challenges have been factored in in the prices and financial stress will reduce as the economy and demand improve.back and reported better operational performance in Q2FY21, even though credit growth has to improve,""  Nair said.""A complete change depends on when the pandemic will subside, which is expected during 2021. Hence, strong buying in the SIP method over the next 6 to 12 months is advisable to build a strong portfolio in banking services.""Nair's top picks are HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank in the private space, Bajaj Finance in NBFC, Bandhan in rural and microfinance and IDFC First as an upcoming bank.Jaikishan Parmar, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Angel Broking, is of the view that due to adequate liquidity and sufficient capital, large banks will gain market share. He has a positive view on ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and IDFC First Bank.Shah from Samco Securities said balance sheets of Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Banks are likely better equipped to sustain the pain than PSUs in the months to come.Mehta of Centrum Wealth Management also likes larger franchises, particularly HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, as they are equipped to handle difficult times and have the potential to gain market share from smaller players.Bhadha of Nirmal Bang is bullish on ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank."

218	1	a	Dolat Capital Market's research report on HCL TechnologiesHCLT reported 4.5% QoQ CC growth (DE: 3.8%) led by strong growth across business segments. OPM improved by 108bps to 21.6% (DE 20.7%) helped by operating efficiency (157bps) that funded investment in P&P 32bps and FX impact 24bps. Pat up 7.5% QoQ at Rs31.4bn. FCF generation took significant leap (swing of over 1bn$ YoY basis) given strong earnings growth, low Capex/acquisition investments and improved DSO (by 11 days YoY). FCF/NI now stands at 146% on TTM basis given increased non-cash charges in P&L. As a result, it has doubled up its quarterly dividend payouts to Rs. 4 per share. HCL retained revenue CQGR at 1.5%-2.5% for Q3/Q4 but has upped the OPM band guidance by 100bps to 20% to 21%. Transformational deal wins were 15, taking the booking TCV up 35% QoQ (flattish on YoY Basis). Growth indicators are strong with pipeline (all-time high), sustained traction in P&P and revival in ERS business due to cloud-led growth.OutlookGiven result beat, confident outlook/commentary, strong lead indicators, improved FCF generation profile we retain HCLT as our Top pick with Buy rating and TP of Rs990 valued at 18x PER on FY23E EPS.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

256	1	a	Dolat Capital Market's research report on Bharti AirtelBharti’s share price has declined sharply (~30%) since the AGR verdict on 1st Sep, 2020. We believe this is on account of news flow of fund-raise by VIL, Jio postpaid plus plan launch and most importantly lack of good news on tariff increase. This is in contrast to expectations of immediate announcement of price hike post the AGR case closure. Our calculation implies that from an ARPU growth, market is now implying a de-growth. However, we still maintain that 15-20% ARPU CAGR is likely and essential for survival of industry.OutlookWe reiterate BUY on Bharti with TP of Rs 605 @ 10/7x Sep22E EV/EBITDA for India Wireless / Africa. Bharti’s TP sensitivity to ARPU is significantly higher viz. ~Rs 40/sh for every Rs 10 change in ARPU @ 10x EV/EBITDA.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

118	1	a	Emkay Global Financial's report on Axis BankAxis reported a PAT of Rs16.8bn (vs. estimated Rs14.6bn) mainly due to better NIMs and contained opex, partly offset by the continued strengthening of contingent provisioning buffer - now at 1.9% of loans (one of the highest among large peers). Overall loan growth was moderate at 11% yoy, including retail growth at 12% yoy/2% qoq. Though the bank has not given any numerical guidance, it expects overall growth trajectory to improve, led by retail and corporate growth largely in better-rated corporates. BB & Below rated corporate pool increased to 2.3% of loans, but Axis expects the overall restructuring pool to be lower at 1.6% of loans, for which it has already made 20% provisioning (10% required). Overall SMA 1 book (30 DPD) was moderate at 2.3% of loans and collection efficiency is expected to reach 97% by Oct’20-end.OutlookWe like Axis’ aggressive stance to front-load provisions, which may depress RoA/RoE at 0.7%/7% in FY21E but should improve to 1.4%/13% by FY23E, aided by better growth, cost ratios and contained provisions. We upgrade Axis to Buy and revise the TP to Rs620 (from Rs520), valuing core bank at 1.5x Dec’22 ABV and subs at Rs23.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

60	0	a	HDFC Securities' research report on ONGCDespite production cuts from OPEC and non-OPEC countries, we expect oil prices to remain at USD 36/41 per barrel in FY21/22E vs. USD 59/bbl in FY20, given the weak global macro. Lower oil and gas realisations will drag profitability down for ONGC. In 2QFY21, revenue was ~4% below our expectations, owing to a lower-than-anticipated crude oil price realisation of USD 41.4/bbl (vs estimate USD 42.7/bbl). EBITDA in 2Q was in line with our estimates. APAT rose by ~55%, courtesy substantially higherthan-anticipated other income, and lower-than-anticipated interest cost.OutlookOur REDUCE recommendation on ONGC with a price target of INR 70 is premised on (1) muted crude oil and gas realisations and (2) lack of production growth for oil.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

326	1	a	Motilal Oswal 's research report on Hindustan UnileverHUVR’s 2QFY21 health, hygiene and nutrition portfolio (80% of the portfolio) grew 10% YoY (v/s ~6% in 1QFY21), discretionary categories (15% of portfolio – skin care, cosmetics, deodorants) declined 25% YoY (v/s ~-45% in 1QFY21), and out-of-home categories (5% of sales) declined 25% YoY (v/s ~-70% in 1QFY21). The company is seeing (a) ad-spends inching up (-5% YoY; ahead of expectations), (b) sharp increase in palm oil costs, and (c) mix deterioration. Thus, HUVR did well in growing its EBITDA margins (including GSKCH) by 30bp YoY and restricting like-for-like margin decline to only 60bp YoY. Margin outlook for HUVR has also improved as share of its discretionary portfolio to total sales should increase sequentially. Outlook for the company is gradually improving. The discretionary part of its portfolio (15% of sales) is seeing gradual recovery. In a period of relative normalcy, we believe that HUVR (as has been the case in recent years) is likely to post superior earnings growth, leading us to maintain Buy rating.OutlookWe remain positive on HUVR from a medium-term perspective encouraged by: (a) robust earnings growth potential beyond the near term owing to its portfolio and execution strengths, and (b) significant synergies in FY22E as a result of GSKCH. These factors suggest premium multiples are likely to sustain. Valuing the company at 55x Sep’22E merged EPS, we arrive at a TP of INR2,620, implying a 21% upside.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Revenue decline was sharp in IT Services (-7.8% QoQ) and ERD (-9% QoQ) and very moderate in Products and Platforms (-2.1% QoQ). EBIT margin performance was impressive & was contained just to -40bps QoQ to 20.5% (Ple:19%, Cons: 19.5%). HCLT expects cc growth of 1.5%-2.5% for the next 3 quarters which translated revenue decline of 0.8%-3.3% $ terms in FY21E. This compares with 0.9-2.2% CQGR implied by Infosys’s revenue outlook and 2.4% by TCS’s intent to achieve flat YoY cc growth by Q4FY21. Margins to be in 19.5% - 20.5% range. HCLT is looking to defend/expand margins in FY21-an impressive thing, in our view. Management believes worst is over and is confident of good growth trajectory- confidence is based on large deals, 40% higher pipeline compared to pre-Covid and stability across verticals such as financial services, healthcare, telecom and CPG. We expect revenue decline of 2.5% $ terms in FY21E. Due to strong margin performance, strong execution & strong recovery in FY22 on pent-up demand led to ~10% for FY22/23.OutlookWe now value HCLT on 15X (33% discount to Infy) & arrive at changed TP of Rs.751 (earlier: Rs.591) on Sep-22 EPS of Rs. 50.1.

277	1	a	"India's largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) will kick off the September quarter earnings season on October 7. It is expected to see sequential decline in Q2FY21 reported profit due to provision in EPIC legal case, but adjusted bottomline may grow in double digit QoQ.The ramp up of large deals is likely to boost dollar revenue growth in the range of 2.5-3 percent and constant currency revenue growth could be in the range of 4.5-5 percent for the quarter ended September 2020, compared to previous quarter (Q1) which was impacted by supply-side constraints.""We expect constant currency revenue growth of 2.8 percent QoQ and cross-currency tailwind of 180 bps on dollar revenue growth. Growth would be driven by absence of supply-side constraints, ramp-up of large deals, and recovery in BFSI, CPG, and communication verticals. Lifescience and healthcare vertical is expected to continue its growth momentum, while retail vertical continues to remain weak owing to higher store closures in the US,"" said Sharekhan.Among brokerages, Dolat Capital expects the maximum growth of 3.1 percent in constant currency revenue QoQ, in view of recovery of billing lost due to supply side impact (135bps) and conversion of robust deal wins (TTM TCV/revenue at 1.3x) to revenue.The earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin is expected to grow in the range of 150-185 basis points QoQ in Q2FY21 due to revenue growth, cost control measures and improved utilisation rate, which ultimately may drive double-digit profit growth sequentially.KR Choksey expects EBIT margin to rise 169bps QoQ on revenue growth, cost control, which will drive adjusted profit growth (13.7 percent QoQ on adjusted basis). ""Including a one-time exceptional item of Rs 1,218 crore due to provision in the EPIC legal case being currently fought by TCS, reported PAT is likely to decline 3.7 percent QoQ,"" the brokerage said.The Nifty IT index was the biggest gainer among sectors in September quarter, rising more than 35 percent with TCS showing a 20 percent rally. The stock gained 23 percent year-to-date.In addition to earnings announcement, TCS is also going to consider a proposal for buyback of equity shares on October 7.Hence, the buyback size and capital allocation strategies would be key thing to watch out for."

233	1	a	"On expected lines, most automakers witnessed a rise in monthly volume on a year-on-year (YoY) basis for the month of November even though volume declined on a month-on-month basis.As the festival period is over, it was expected that the demand will ease on monthly basis.A significant pick-up in demand was seen for commercial vehicles (CV) while passenger vehicles (PV), two-wheelers (2W) and tractors also did well.Ashutosh Tiwari, Head of Research at Equirus Securities pointed out there was an element of pent-up demand as sales were lower in Q1FY21, but the shift towards personal mobility was also a reason behind demand pick up.""Sales also benefited from increased savings of service class and government employees as there were limited avenues for spending since the COVID outbreak. Lower finance cost is also helping demand,"" Tiwari said.As the economy is improving and the vaccine for COVID-19 looks near, is the road for automakers going to be smooth now?Brokerages and analysts expect volumes to improve in the coming quarters on strong rural sentiment, low-interest rates, improving finance availability and a gradual pick-up in the business and economic activity.""We believe that post the festive season, the inventory for passenger car OEMs is below the average 30-day levels, which has led to the growth. Over the rest of the year, we expect sales trends to be better than what was earlier expected as the economy is gradually normalising,"" said Aditya Makharia, Institutional Research Analyst (Auto), HDFC Securities.However, the road for all segments is not going to be the same.""Festive season sales were reasonable, with no major negative surprise.

Hence, we prefer companies with: a) higher visibility in terms of demand recovery, b) a strong competitive positioning, c) margin drivers, and d) balance sheet strength,"" Motilal Oswal added.Tiwari of Equirus Securities believes there is likely to be a sluggish period over the next 2-3 months due to seasonal weakness post festivals, but he expects demand to pick up again from March-April 2021 as rural demand will pick up post-harvest and with COVID cases subsiding even earnings of business class people will revive.Brokerage firm ICICI Securities pointed out that the rising incentive schemes across segments post-festive season, lack of price increase even in wake of higher input costs correlate with the fragility of the consumer sentiment.""We believe channel inventory clearance remains a key priority for December; thus, expect incentives to increase further by the end of Q3,"" ICICI Securities said.Pankaj Bobade, Head - Fundamental Research, Axis Securities is of the view with the festive season now over in India, the auto industry volumes to moderate in Q4FY21 as the pent-up demand is tapering down and fresh demand has to kick in to sustain the growth.""Generally, the December month witnesses tepid growth at the retail level, as the end-users await the vehicle with chassis plate of the new year. Hence, the short-term (2 months) outlook would be relatively soft compared to the festive season but we expect the auto industry to post a strong double-digit recovery over FY22 and FY23 on the back of improving fundamentals, a low base of FY20 and FY21 and recovery in the other sectors of the economy,"" Bobade said.Rusmik Oza, Executive Vice President and Head of Fundamental Research-PCG at Kotak Securities has a cautious view on the automobile sector as stock prices have rallied smartly on the back of better results and healthy volume growth.""We expect net profits of the automobiles sector to increase 11 percent in FY21 despite very low volumes in Q1FY21 (affected by the nation-wide lockdown in the months of April and May 2020),"" Oza said.For the medium-term, Oza expects the motorcycle industry to grow at 12-20 percent in FY22-23 after a sharp decline in FY21.

Time Frame: Six months.Technical ViewIT sector has been one of the major outperformer in the last five months pullback since market bottoming out in March 2020. In the last one month breather, the IT stocks has shown resilience and has formed a higher base for the next leg of up move. IT major TCS has lead the way and has recently generated a breakout above the last two year almost identical highs (Rs 2275 and 2296 respectively) highlighting strength and positive price structure. The entire breather of the last one month has taken the shape of a bullish Flag formation and during current week trade it has registered a breakout above the same thus offering fresh entry opportunity. We expect the stock to continue its up move and head towards Rs 2650 levels in the coming months as it is the 138.2% external retracement of the entire decline (Rs 2296-1506) placed around Rs 2650 levels.Fundamental ViewTata Consultancy Services (TCS) is an IT service company catering to various segments like Banking & Insurance (~30% of revenues), communication (~7%), manufacturing (~10%), life science & healthcare (~8%), technology & services (~9%), Regional Markets (~20%) and CPG & retail (~15%). Geographically, the company generates ~52% revenues from Americas, 31% from Europe and 17% from rest of the world. Considering the company’s ability to win large deals, platform differentiation and client mining capability, we expect TCS to bounce back faster than peers as seen in historical performance. In addition, TCS’ Secure Borderless Workspace (SBW) delivery model and Machine First Delivery Model (MFDM) framework will provide unique differentiation for its services. We believe there are long term drivers for the company in terms of market share gains, acceleration in digital technologies and vendor consolidation based on company’s execution. Hence, we expect the company to continue registering industry leading revenue growth in coming years. Further, in terms of margins, we expect the company to see a meaningful recovery in FY22E mainly led by cost rationalisation. The company’s knack of winning large deals across segments & geographies, strong execution, cost rationalisation and client mining capability it has been able to register consistent performance in revenues and margins.

13	1	a	Motilal Oswal's research report on ICICI BankWe attended ICICI Bank (ICICIBC)'s Analyst Day, wherein the bank highlighted the progress in its different businesses and how the bank is positioned to capitalize on the exciting opportunities in the space. The topics of discussion constituted (a) how the management is trying to build a strong bank with best-in-class digital capabilities, (b) using technology to accelerate growth across business verticals and maintaining healthy operating metrics, (c) focusing on identifying potential micro markets for expansion, (d) strong demand recovery in consumption loans, with disbursements in secured loans surpassing pre-COVID levels, and (e) how asset quality has remained resilient, with the bank maintaining one of the highest coverages among private banks. ICICI Bank has historically been a technology-savvy bank and has several innovations to its credit. However, systemic asset quality concerns have taken the center-stage and diverted investor focus away from the strong digital capabilities/innovations built by the bank. New digital innovations have positioned the bank well to gain incremental market share across key product lines. ICICIBC carries an additional provision buffer of 1.3% of loans, besides robust PCR. It has suggested in the past that corporate restructuring is likely to account for less than 100bp of loans.OutlookThe bank expects credit cost to normalize fully in FY22E, which would accelerate earnings growth. We estimate FY22/FY23 RoA at 1.5%/1.7%, enabling the bank to deliver FY23E RoE of 15.2%. We reiterate ICICIBC as one of our top buys in the sector and revise our SOTP-based Target Price to INR630 (2.2x Sep'22e ABV for the bank).For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

257	1	a	ICICI Direct's research report on Bharti AirtelDerivatives & Quantitative OutlookIn the past three months, Bharti Airtel has underperformed the Nifty by falling 30%, compared to 9% upside in the Nifty. The fall in Bharti Airtel was due to negative news flows. Reduced weightage in MSCI and FTSE also added pressure and has dragged the stock lower. Recently, the Nifty witnessed long liquidation. Due to that, the October series of Nifty open interest (OI) is one of the lowest seen in the last 10 years. At the same time, most of the stock futures have started the October series with significantly low open interest. In contrast, the OI in Bharti has remained prominent while the current OI in the stock is the highest seen in the last 10 year. We believe the recent short positions in the stock are still intact. This is expected to get covered near the support zone of Rs 400-420 levels.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Recovery has also been seen in the Water Purifier business, which was adversely affected in 1QFY21. With the Ice-Cream business being a washout in 1QFY21, it contributed significantly to business decline in the quarter. However, the Ice-Cream business is much less salient in the base quarter of 2QFY21 (2QFY20) v/s 1QFY21. Therefore, 2QFY21 is not expected to be as drastically impacted by the Ice-Cream business as 1QFY21.OutlookWe remain positive on HUVR from a medium-term perspective, encouraged by: (a) robust earnings growth potential beyond the near term owing to its portfolio and execution strengths and (b) significant synergies in FY22E as a result of GSKCH.

Time Frame: Six months.Technical ViewThe IT sector remain in secular up trend since bottoming out in March 2020. As the major IT companies as trading at their all-time highs and are forming higher peak and higher trough in all time frame. The share price of Tech Mahindra is currently placed at the previous multiple high since February 2019 around Rs 840-850 levels. We expect the stock to resolve above the same and extend the current up move. Our expectation of resolving above the major hurdle of Rs 840-850 is based on the following key observations:a) the entire consolidation of the last eight months has taken the shape of a bullish rounding formation signalling a reversal of the corrective trend and resumption of fresh up move.b) it has witnessed a faster retracement as it has completely retraced its previous four quarter decline (Rs 846-471) in just two quarters.c) the last quarter up move is backed by strong volume of highest since CY 2009 highlighting larger participation.Hence, we expect the stock to continue with its positive momentum and head towards Rs 950 levels in the coming months as it is the 123.6% external retracement of the entire CY’20 decline (Rs 846-471).Fundamental ViewTech Mahindra is an IT service company catering to various segments like communication (~40%), manufacturing (~17%), technology, media & entertainment (~9%), Banking Financial, Services & insurance (~16%), retail transport & logistics (~7.3%) and others (11.2%). Geographically, the company generates ~49% revenues from Americas, 26% from Europe and 25% from rest of the world. The company is aiming to improve revenues and reaching industry leading growth by focusing on cross sell opportunities. The company is also increasing its. resource allocation to high growth geographies and reducing its focus on emerging & low growth geographies. Apart from improving revenues, the company is also rationalising cost to improve margins. The company aims to improve margins by improving margins of portfolio companies, lowering of discretionary spend, lower facility cost, lower travel cost, increased automation in some of the service lines, higher offshoring and benefits of large deal won in previous quarter. We believe ramp up of large deal won in previous quarters and improvement in deal wins in coming quarters will drive revenues. Further, in the long term, we believe its leadership in communication vertical will make it a key beneficiary of vendor consolidation in the segment. It would also benefit from 5G opportunities. Enterprise segment will also benefit from improved digital traction, success in large deals. Hence, we remain positive on the stock.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

12	1	a	Emkay Global Financial's report on ICICI BankOur Digi-Banking Conference on November 26 emphasized that the Digital thrust is turbocharged due to Covid-19, while digitization and ‘fintegration’ are the way forward for incumbents. Over the years, ICICI has been evolving into a full-stack digital bank with endto-end digital solutions across businesses and is well-poised to ride the digital boom. ICICI Bank has made adequate investments in digital platforms, leading to virtually no outages - unlike its large peers that have recently faced regulatory ire - and better customer wallet share/profitability. The bank believes that its focus on balanced ‘Phygital strategy’ and customer life-cycle banking should lead to better revenues, cost savings - boosting core-profitability in the long run. Although the discussions were centered around digital initiatives, management reassured its long-standing risk-calibrated growth strategy, focus on customer-level profitability and better asset-quality experience in the current cycle with adequate provisioning buffers in place.OutlookWe believe that ICICI’s likely strong delivery on growth, asset quality and return ratios despite the Covid-induced disruption, coupled with its evolution as a strong retail-cumdigital bank, will call for a re-rating.

Based on presentations the bank continues to embrace on “One Bank One ROE” principle with retained focus on core operating profitability by either improving revenue lines or by reducing cost/improving efficiency via digital. The bank has immensely benefitted from this despite some hiccups, but then for next few years we see these initiatives clearly supporting business growth and enhancing operating profitability.

232	1	a	Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL) on December 3 informed that the Suzuki Brezza will not be manufactured by Toyota at its Bengaluru plant in 2022.  Another unidentified model will be produced in its place, the car market leader said.This change brings curtains on the agreement that allowed Maruti to source the Brezza from Toyota. In March 2019, the board of Maruti Suzuki cleared proposals to partly source the Brezza compact sports utility vehicle (SUV) from Toyota Kirloskar Motors (TKM) as a part of the broader non-equity based agreement signed between Suzuki and Toyota in February 2017.The change comes barely 20 months after Toyota and Suzuki agreed to share models as part of the broader international agreement between the two companies. Toyota sources the Brezza from Maruti Suzuki but not before it is rebadged, marketed and sold as Urban Cruiser from its own showrooms.“Vide our letter dated March 27, 2019, we had informed you about the decision of the Board to manufacture Vitara Brezza at the existing plant of Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) starting year 2022. The Board has, today, approved to change the model to be manufactured at TKM from Vitara Brezza to another model,” said MSIL in a statement sent to the BSE.Brezza is the second model supplied by Suzuki to Toyota in India with the first being the Maruti Suzuki Baleno which is rebadged as Toyota Glanza. The Urban Cruiser was launched by Toyota in early October in India being priced higher than the Maruti Brezza.MSIL declined to comment when approached for further clarity on the matter including the reason behind the sudden change. The copy will be updated with TKM’s comments as soon as they are shared.Last year, Suzuki even dabbled with the idea of moving the entire production of the Brezza to Toyota plants. This would have allowed MSIL to free up capacity at its Haryana plant which also makes the Urban Cruiser.Following the launch of Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, Maruti’s share in the compact SUV segment has recorded a slide. From being the largest SUV maker in India MSIL’s position in the compact SUV segment has come down to the third spot.

49	1	a	"Tata Steel has confirmed that it's in talks with Sweden's SSAB to sell its unit in the Netherlands, the flagship of its operations in Europe.This is a fresh attempt from India's largest steelmaker to find a solution to its troubles in Europe, more than a year after a merger with Germany's thyssenkrupp was blocked by European Commission.The company said it has ""commenced discussions with the Supervisory Board and Board of Management of Tata Steel Netherlands and the process will move to the next stage including due diligence and stakeholders’ consultations."" The Netherlands unit has an annual capacity of 7.5 million tonne and has 10,000 employees.Proceeds from the sale will be used to lower the debt on the company's books. Tata Steel Europe has a debt of 1.7 billion Euros.Simultaneously, the company has also begun the process of separating Tata Steel Netherlands and Tata Steel UK, and ""will pursue separate strategic paths for the Netherlands and the UK business in the future"", it said. The company has been in talks with the UK government for financial aid to shore up its operations in the country.""There will be stages in this transaction, and will close it in six to nine months,"" Executive Director and CFO Koushik Chatterjee, said during an analyst call on November 13.CEO and Managing Director TV Narendran added that the company is ""not expecting competition commission issues"" like in its earlier proposed merger with Germany's thyssenkrupp.The merger with thyseenkrupp was blocked by the European Commission in 2019, and turned out to be a big setback for Tata Steel in its attempt to find a solution to the European puzzle. Since its 2006 acquisition of Corus, which was later renamed Tata Steel Europe, the operations have for most of the years incurred losses and were dependent on the Indian parent to stay afloat.The Commission had said that the merged entity, which would have been the second largest in Europe after ArcelorMittal, would have hurt competition in some of the segments, including  packaging steel, auto-grade steel and electrical steel.The company is now hoping that the deal with SSAB will have a better fate with the Commission. Narendran said that the merged entity, that of Tata  Steel Netherlands and SSAB, won't have a significant presence in packaging or auto steel.SSAB is known for making steel that is used in making machinery and equipment that have application in mining, earth moving and construction segments.What happens to Tata Steel UK?The big question is now on the future of the UK operations, which have been the biggest drag on the company. Overall in Europe, about 70 to 80 percent of the EBITDA comes from the Dutch unit.The UK operations, which churn out about 5 million tons of steel a year, have been a subject of much debate and consternation, as was again seen during the analyst call on Friday, as many analysts repeatedly asked about the future of the unit.Narendran reiterated that the focus of the company is make the UK operations self-sustainable and not dependent on cash injections from the Indian parent. ""In the last six months, which have been very challenging, the UK operations have not needed help,"" he said."
116	0	a	"The pandemic due to COVID-19 has ushered in an inflection point in the entire banking system which is going to bring in radical changes in terms of lending parameters, MD and CEO of Axis Bank Amitabh Chaudhary said on December 11.Speaking at a session on financial system organised by XLRI, he said that the COVID crisis has created a huge disruption in the banking system in the country where individual banks are feeling its impact. He said that due to the pandemic, individuals ability to repay loans has reduced significantly while 90 percent of the banks' books is in moratorium.""The crisis has increased the health costs and the average individual household needs money while banks at the same time will have to be more cautious. A vicious negative cycle has set in while discretionary spending has hit an all time low"", Chaudhary said.At Axis, he said the bank has been able to raise capital to provide comfort to the depositors while the provision coverage ratio has gone up from 70 per cent to 124 per cent. Chaudhary said that the bank had also been modernising its monitoring aspects leading to fall in GNPA and NNPA levels.According to him, the banking system will have to opt for more granular mode using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) which will form the basis of lending decisions.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Chaudhary also said that data points like credit card payments and salary pay-outs will also be used for taking a lending decision. This, he said, will be supplemented by robust underwriting, also determine the long-term survival potential of the sectors and also look at the history of the promoters who are seeking loans.Chaudhary said Axis bank had activated its quick response team before the crisis surfaced in India looking at the experience of China.He also said that for the first time, stress is building up in the retail sector putting the banks in a precarious situation which will have an impact on the price of loans and interest rates."

37	1	a	Anand Rathi 's research report on Larsen and ToubroDespite the challenging environment, L&T’s Q2FY21 execution was broadly in line with our estimates. Its consolidated revenue fell 12% y/y (ARe -10%) and EBITDA margin was 10.7% (11.4% a year ago). Its Services division was slightly down, cushioning the drop in its E&C business (-17% y/y). Domestic revenue fell 18% y/y, while exports were down ~2% y/y. Management talked of a strong opportunity pipeline of Rs6trn (Rs4.7trn domestic, Rs1.3trn exports), but refrained from offering guidance for FY21. With labour availability and supply-chain-related issues now past, we expect a pick-up in execution in H2 FY21.OutlookNWC was elevated (26.7%), likely to improve with the pickup in execution.

65	1	a	ICICI Securities research report on Oil and Natural Gas CorporationA committee has been set up to suggest changes to the prevailing price formula under which gas price fell to US$2/mmbtu in H2FY21. As per press reports, it may propose US$1/mmbtu discount to JKM spot LNG as the floor price. We are optimistic that a floor price would soon be introduced, at which ONGC would make money (its average production cost is US$3.7/mmbtu). Floor price may be US$4.2/mmbtu, which ONGC has asked for since FY17, or linked to JKM spot LNG. Reports also suggest GoI may gradually deregulate price of nomination acreage (APM) gas over not more than six years. This may be the roadmap for uniform market-determined price for all gas produced in India, which the oil minister has often talked of. GoI on 7th Oct’20 approved the procedure to be followed to ensure price of deregulated gas was truly market-determined.OutlookWe expect gains for ONGC in the near term from the imminent revision in gas price formula and in the medium term from gas price deregulation.
