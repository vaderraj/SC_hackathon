Divis Labs,"Dec 17, 2020, 10:20 AM IST",6 stocks seeing profit margin growth for 4 straight quarters,"NEW DELHI: Six companies from the BSE500 pack have reported growth in profit margins for back-to-back four quarters. Five of these stocks have climbed up to 356 per cent so far this year, against a 12 per cent rise in the Sensex. They include Laurus Labs, Divi’s Laboratories, Mindtree, Aegis Logistics and Ambuja Cements. The sixth stock, Vakrangee, is up 6 per cent this year.

The margin gains for these firms in the last four quarters were in the 5-13 percentage points range.

Laurus Labs’ PAT margin stood at 21.27 per cent in September quarter compared with 17.73 per cent in June quarter, 13.12 per cent in March quarter, 10.07 per cent in the December quarter of 2019 and 7.93 per cent in the September quarter of 2019. The stock is up 356 per cent so far this year.

Laurus has a portfolio with more than 60 commercialised APIs with strong presence in antiretroviral, oncology, anti-diabetic and Hepatitis-C therapeutic segments. The company forayed into the formulation business on a large scale in FY20, resulting in major revenue gains from that segment i.e. about 29 per cent in FY20 against about 2 per cent during FY19.

""Based on growth visibility in the formulations business as well as in the API segment, we are confident of sustaining the earnings momentum. The company is well positioned for long-term growth,"" said Anand Rathi Financial Services.

Divi’s Labs has seen margin rise 5.02 percentage points to 28.43 per cent in the September quarter from 24.68 per cent in the year-ago period. This stock is up 95 per cent for 2020 so far.

""Divi’s, over the year, has emerged as a preferred partner for several key customers for synthesis projects, with expertise in scaling up high tonnage products. The custom synthesis business is a margin accretive one, but at times it is lumpy in nature. However, as of the September quarter, the business showed good recovery on account of an improved business environment,"" Sharekhan said.

Strong earnings visibility, almost zero debt and strong return ratios bode well for the company from a growth perspective. Besides, the company does not have any pending regulatory hurdles, which is a key positive, analysts said.

Mindtree shares have rallied 80 per cent this calendar. Margins grew 6.1 percentage points to 13.17 per cent at the end of the September quarter from 7.05 per cent in the year-ago period.

ICICI Securities said there is no management plan for a merger between L&T Infotech and Mindtree. The brokerage sees steady PAT margin of 14.5 per cent by FY23. This is when Mindtree’s cost structure should become identical to that of L&T Infotech, it said.

“A higher share of fixed price projects and continued focus on tail account rationalisation should be key margin drivers for the company. Multiples are undemanding at 19 times FY22 EPS on our estimates, as we have already factored in the potential for further margin surprise,"" ICICI Securities said.

Aegis Logistics is also seeing an improvement in margins. The company, which reported losses for the September quarter of 2019, has gradually increased PAT margin to 9.86 per cent at the end of the September quarter of 2020. The rise in margin for this company was due to continued strong performance by the liquids division and revival of the gas logistics business. The company is expecting a jump in gas throughput by 2.0 mmtpa in next two years. The stock has three ‘buy’ calls and two ‘outperform’ calls as of today, as per publicly available data with Reuters.

Ambuja Cements’ PAT margin improved to 12.97 per cent in the September quarter from 8.70 per cent in the year-ago quarter. The stock had 12 'buy' calls and 13 'outperform' calls as of Tuesday, December 15. It also had 9 'hold' and 2 'sell' calls. September was Ambuja Cements’ third quarter straight consistent outperformance vis-a-vis Street expectations. Analysts see the stock as a potential re-rating candidate.

Vakrangee, meanwhile, gained a mere 6 per cent this year despite seeing a 11.79 percentage points surge in margins. That said, the stock is up 206 per cent over its 52-week low of Rs 17.10 hit in April."

Traditionally, it is considered overbought condition when the RSI value is above 70 and oversold condition when it is below 30. Chartists say, RSI should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way fundamental analysts cannot give a 'buy' or'sell' recommendation using a single valuation ratio."

Bajaj Finserv, IndusInd Bank, Nestle India and Tata Steel were among the stocks that saw biggest drops in MF holdings, while Adani Ports, Dr Reddy's Labs and HCL Technologies were among a few that saw buying by the desi fund managers during the month.

One of the stocks that saw the biggest selloff by MFs was Bajaj Finserv. Mutual fund holding in terms of number of Bajaj Finserv shares held by 19 mutual funds declined 18.9 per cent during the month to 46 lakh shares.

""In March, there was a record outflow from FPIs and record buying by domestic institutional investors. If I have to choose a time to invest, I would always choose March over November. If my investors are booking profit, so be it. At lower levels, I will be a buyer rather than a seller. Having said that, November, like October and September, saw profit booking by our clients. We have seen redemptions by people who were in financial need,” said Nilesh Shah of Kotak AMC.

Shah said it is not that fund managers are selling because they find the market expensive. Rather, it’s because investors are redeeming. “Our cash levels remained virtually stagnant over the last eight-nine months,"" he said. 

Redemptions by MF investors rose 26.7 per cent month-on-month (MoM) in November to Rs 28,100-odd crore while sales of equity schemes fell 18.4 per cent MoM to Rs 14,900 crore. This led to the highest ever net outflows of Rs 13,200 crore from mutual funds.

Maruti Suzuki saw MF holding rise 4.3 per cent to 2.36 crore shares. In Grasim, they held 1.7 per cent more shares than in October.

M&M, SBI, Sun Pharma and Coal India were some of the companies that saw MF buying during the month.

""Reasons of the selling could vary from risk-profiling to valuation concerns. There are multiple reasons why money is going out and it is natural that when money has been coming in for four-five months at a stretch, some amount of it will go out,"" Swarup Mohanty, CEO at Mirae Asset Global told ETNOW."

More than a strong performance, important narrative for Divi’s is unprecedented capex to further augment capacity besides preparing for growing opportunities arising from China plus one factor. It has earmarked an aggressive capex of ~Rs 2800 crore, over and above ~Rs 2000 crore spent in last five years. Impact of this massive investment is already visible and is expected to reflect in FY21-22.

IndusInd Bank,"Dec 14, 2020, 03:06 PM IST",Up 300% & counting! ​Nifty50’s worst performer of 2020 witnesses best rebound since March,"NEW DELHI: Nifty50’s worst performer of Calendar 2020 has fallen 39 per cent this year against an 11 per cent rise in the benchmark index. Yet, its rebound from March lows has been spectacular, thanks to a buying frenzy seen among the foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) to buy the scrip at depressed valuations.

The scrip has recovered a 292 per cent since March 23, the best among the Nifty stocks, making investors wonder whether it can continue the winning spree. 

The stock is IndusInd Bank. Data showed FPI holding in the private lender touched 73.6 per cent last week.

Strong FPI buying helped the stock’s valuation improve to 1.5 times its one-year forward price to adjusted book value (P/AVB) per share from a distressed level of 0.4 times hit in March.

On a trailing basis, however, the price-to-book of 1.8 times today is still well below the 10-year average P/BV of 2.7 per cent.

The stock has a consensus ‘outperform’ rating, with 15 ‘buy’ and 14 ‘outperform’ recommendations on the publicly available Reuters Eikon database. Besides, the scrip also has nine ‘hold’ recommendations following the sharp rebound seen in recent months.

ICICI Securities in a note said restoration of depositors’ trust is reversing outflows seen in the previous quarters, which is providing comfort to investors on the liquidity front.

Recent capital raising by the lender demonstrates its ability to strengthen the balance sheet, it said, adding that the recommendations of the RBI Working Committee to raise the cap on promoter holdings from 15 per cent to 26 per cent and the promoters’ intention of increasing stake provide comfort, he said.

“With the balance sheet realignment over and deposit flow revived, the bank management is set to pedal asset growth with retail in focus. Though the extent of slippages impacted by the pandemic is yet to be seen, improving collection and a low quantum of restructuring may keep the asset quality pressure manageable,” the brokerage said.

Suresh Ganapathy of Macquarie told ET that the stock could have more upside if its asset quality improves. “There were worries that the bank would see a run on deposits, but it has seen good stabilisation on the deposit franchise since then,” Ganapathy told ET.

Phillip Capital said the stock’s valuations are no longer at distressed levels. Its return to a normalised growth trajectory and credit cost would be key drivers for further re-ratings, it said, adding that the aftermath of the moratorium could start hitting banks.

“We see challenges in terms of growth and see a long wait before credit cost normalises. We model in 3.3 per cent slippage and 4 per cent standard restructuring in FY21,” this brokerage said.

In a note last month, JM Financial said while it expects FY21 credit costs to remain high for the bank given the impact of Covid-19 and expects impaired asset ratios to inch up, “the seeds for creating the right mix of growth and quality were being sown.”

It said the focus on shoring up provisions despite having strong PPOP-profile, ‘retailisation’ of deposit base despite decadal low wholesale funding costs and a more balanced fee mix – which is transaction-oriented than balance sheet-driven – would be key indicators for creating a medium-term, steady profitability profile for the bank."

Should you still consider top Nifty gainers?,"NEW DELHI: As Nifty50 hit an all-time high of 13,145 on Wednesday, rising from a low of 7,515 hit on March 24, eight index stocks have doubled investors’ money, rising anywhere between 100 per cent and 174 per cent.

Five of these stocks have consensus ‘buy’, two have 'hold' while one an ‘underperform’ ratings now.


These list includes:


IndusInd Bank: Outperform
Up 174 per cent since March 24, this banking stock has 18 'buy' calls, 12 'outperform', 10 ‘hold’, three 'underperform' and two 'sell' ratings, as per publicly available Reuters' Eikon database. Analysts said the recent capital raising has strengthened the balance sheet and the bank may gradually see improvement in profitability as credit costs normalise. Nomura India expects a credit cost of 310 basis points for FY21 and 190 bps for FY22. It pegs loan growth for the bank at 4 per cent for FY21 and 12 per cent for ROE is seen at 8 per cent for FY21 and 12 per cent for FY22.


M&M: Outperform
Shares of this automaker have 16 'buy' calls, 18 'outperform', two 'hold', one 'underperform' and two 'sell' calls. Phillip Capital expects M&M to benefit from relatively buoyant sentiment in the rural economy due to good Rabi harvest, expectation of high Kharif harvest and higher MSPs. The brokerage in a note said that light commercial vehicles are doing well and the launch of Thar followed by Scorpio and XUV500 facelifts should shore up personal vehicle volumes.

“The company continues to follow up on its commitment to address capital allocation concerns by being prudent and culling loss making subsidiaries gives us comfort,"" the brokerage noted. The stock is up 169 per cent since March 24 against Nifty's 75 per cent rise.


Tata Motors: Hold
In a note this week, Edelweiss said it is positive on JLR’s upcoming product pipeline, which will improve its mix towards the more profitable Land Rover brand. Demand across some of its key markets should normalise it said, adding that a tight cost control should bolster profitability.

""We believe the capex cycle has peaked and containing capex spend should also spur JLR’s FCF. For the India business, after two years of slowdown, we expect volumes to recover gradually,"" it said. FCF stands for free cash flow,"" it said. HDFC Institutional Equities has also upgraded the stock to ‘buy’. While brokerages are turning positive on the stock, the stock still has a consensus 'hold' rating, as per Reuters' Eikon database, following a 153 per cent rise since March 24.


Hindalco: Buy
This aluminium maker has 13 'buy' and 10 'outperform' calls, but no 'hold', 'underperform' or 'sell' calls. JM Financial said Hindalco’s strategic capital allocation in downstream rolling (Novelis, Aleris) has helped the company establish itself as a market leader in aluminium rolled products, revamping its legacy business model of being an aluminium manufacturer and reducing Ebitda volatility vis-à-vis peers in the process.

“India operations with its 90 per cent plus coal security stands to benefit disproportionately with the rise in LME aluminium price. Hindalco’s investment appeal comes from the rising volumes at Novelis enabling operating leverage to kick-in, FCF yield of 13-16 per cent over FY22E-FY23 making way for significant de-leveraging, now that the bulk of the capex is behind,"" it said. The stock is up 153 per cent since March 24.


JSW Steel: Hold
This steel stock has four 'buy', four 'outperform' 13 'hold', six 'underperform' and three 'sell' ratings. Analysts said while volume improvement is all likely, iron ore cost to the company may stay high despite improving integration, as captive iron ore is coming at a huge premium and would thus limit spread improvement. High debt and tendency for continuous expansion keeps them cautious following a 132 per cent rise in the stock since March 24. The company so far is not expecting net debt to increase in FY21, excluding that related to Bhushan power acquisition.


Grasim: Outperform
This auto stock has two 'buy', four 'outperform' and five 'hold' calls. It has no ‘underperform’ or ‘sell’ ratings, as per Reuters' database. Edelweiss said Grasim is a value play as its 57 per cent stake in UltraTech Cement alone, excluding the holding company, and exceeds its current market-cap by 46 per cent. “With the worst being largely behind for standalone business and management’s focus on prioritising capital for organic growth is positive,” the brokerage said.

The risk of investment in group companies like Vodafone Idea remains a key overhang and the reason behind the holding company discount, said Kotak Securities which has an 'add' rating on the stock. The stock is up 114 per cent since March 24.


RIL: Outperform
This stock has 11 'buy' calls, nine 'outperform' seven 'hold', four 'underperform' and one 'sell' ratings. Prabhudas Lilladher said the company's stated objective is to monetise and forge global partnership across businesses, is well positioned to incubate new business and pursue inorganic opportunities given its liquid balance sheet. “Despite a sharp run-up in stock prices, we believe positive news flow on global partnerships or stake sale is likely to keep valuations at elevated level,” it said in a note. This stock has gained 111 per cent since March lows.


Wipro: Underperform
The IT stock, which has rallied 100 per cent since March 24, is a consensus ‘underperform’, as per Reuters. At its analyst day, Wipro’s MD & CEO Thierry Delaporte shared his plan for a bolder Wipro and to revive the company's growth by having a high performance culture and simplification of its organisation structure. Following that, IDBI Capital has introduced its FY23 financials and forecast revenue and upgraded the stock's target to Rs 366 based on PE of 18 times FY23, which is near to the top-end of the one-year forward P/E range of 10-21 times in the last five years.

""The market rally, which was led by developments on vaccine and FPI inflows, came to a halt today due to profit booking across sectors in the second half of the trading session.

European shares hover near 9-month highsEuropean shares eased slightly, while staying near nine-month highs on Wednesday as a relaxation of coronavirus restrictions in the region and growing hopes that a vaccine would soon be ready kept sentiment afloat. The pan-European STOXX 600 index inched lower by 0.1% as gains in the utility and telecom sector were outweighed by losses in automobile stocks .


Tech view: Nifty forms 'Bearish Engulfing' candleNifty50 saw steep selling pressure after hitting a record high on Wednesday, as the index ended up forming a 'Bearish Engulfing' candle on the daily chart.

The index formed a small-bodied candle on the daily scale, as there was buying at lower levels, and closed positive with a gain of 67 points. Nifty has got stuck between 12,730 and 12,950 level since the last six sessions. Now, it has to hold above the 12,750-12,800 zone to witness a bounce towards 13,050 and 13,200 levels, while a hold below the same level may trigger weakness towards 12,700 and then 12,650 levels.

India VIX rose 6 per cent from 19.62 to 20.79 levels. Volatility has cooled down further and needs to hold at lower levels to ride the momentum with a higher market base.

On the options front, maximum Put Open Interest stood at 12,000 level followed by 12,800, while maximum Call OI was at 13,500 followed by 13,000 levels. There was Call writing at strike prices 13,500 and 13,200, while Put writing was seen at 12,900 and then 12,600 levels. Options data suggested a trading range between 12,750 and 13,100 levels.

Bank Nifty opened positive, but failed to hold the 29,500 level and drifted towards the 28,850 mark in the first half of the session. However, the market saw a recovery from lower levels and ended the day with around 200 points loss to close just above the 29,000 mark.

The index formed a Bearish Candle on the daily scale and relatively underperformed the benchmark index. It has been consolidating between 28,500 and 29,800 levels since last five sessions and requires followup action to commence the next leg of rally. Now, the index needs to hold above 29,000 level to witness a bounce towards 29,500 and then 29,800 levels, while on the downside, support exists at 28,750 and then 28,500 levels.

Nifty futures closed positive at 12,941 level with 0.54 per cent gains. The trade setup looked positive in IndusInd Bank, Dr Reddy’s Labs, Infosys, TCS, ONGC, Bajaj Finance, Divi’s Lab, Coforge and Hero Moto but weak in HDFC, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, L&T , Bharti Airtel and Titan.

HDFC,"Dec 15, 2020, 09:03 PM IST",Ahead of Market: 12 things that will decide stock action on Wednesday,"NEW DELHI: Nifty added a few points on Tuesday than its previous close and formed a small bullish candle with a long lower shadow similar to a Doji formation on the daily chart.

The daily chart signals a capped upside going forward. Nifty has formed an indecisive pattern similar to that of Doji candles in the last five out of six sessions, suggesting that the rally is losing momentum.

According to Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities, the short-term trend of Nifty continues to be rangebound within a high low band of 13,600-13,400 levels. He added, “A sustainable move above 13,600 levels is expected to result in Nifty continuing with next round of sharp upside momentum and inch towards the next upside levels of 13,900 in the near term.""

""The Indian market opened with a negative trend, following weak sentiments in Asian markets, but a strong recovery happened as the European market opened positively ahead of the Fed and the ECB policy meetings. The outcome of these meetings are expected to be positive, triggering further positivity in the market,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.


That said, here’s a look at what some of the key indicators are suggesting for Wednesday's action:US stocks gain on stimulus hopes 
US stock indexes rose on Tuesday as progress toward a massive government spending bill and COVID-19 relief measures kept spirits high, while investors awaited new economic cues from the Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 133.99 points, or 0.45%, at 29,995.54, the S&P 500 was up 26.03 points, or 0.71%, at 3,673.52. The Nasdaq Composite was up 105.53 points, or 0.85%, at 12,545.57.


European shares rise on vaccine optimismEuropean shares rose on Tuesday, with optimism from vaccine roll-outs helping investors shake off nervous early trades as rising COVID-19 cases result in tighter curbs across the continent. Vaccination drive in the United States, the latest Western country after the UK, boosted sentiment, lifting the pan-European STOXX 600 index. However, the index erased losses and was trading flat.


Tech View: Nifty bulls defending supportNifty50 on Tuesday tested its immediate support range at 13,450-470, before recovering and closing in the black. With this, the index formed an indecisive Doji candle on the daily chart for the fourth consecutive day. The bulls seem to be defending the support levels rigorously, but the upside seems limited, analysts said. “The bulls are constantly protecting the 13,400-13,450 zone in intraday declines. On the upside, the bears are protecting the 13,550-13,600 zone. Moreover, multiple Doji and Hanging Man candlestick patterns on the daily chart suggest lack of momentum in the uptrend. A trade below 13,400 level may trigger sharp corrections in Nifty to 13,200-13,100 levels. The RSI is also suggesting lack of momentum on the upside,"" said Aditya Agarwala, Senior Technical Analyst at YES Securities.

HDFC,"Dec 16, 2020, 09:20 AM IST",Team Prashant Jain at HDFC Mutual Fund dumping high-flying stocks to pick laggards,"NEW DELHI: HDFC Mutual Fund lapped up select underperformers from the mining, FMCG and power sectors during the November market rally that lifted BSE benchmark Sensex 11 per cent to 44,150, on firm global cues, sustained inflows from foreign institutional investors and progress on Covid-19 vaccine.

Investment managers led by Prashant Jain at the country’s second-largest money manager increased exposure to Coal India, whose shares are down 1.30 per cent since the beginning of this financial year. It bought nearly 80 lakh shares in the world’s single largest coal producer last month.

The fund house also picked over 40 lakh shares each in REC and ITC. Shares of the former have gained 53 per cent to Rs 136 as of December 11 from Rs 88 on March 31, while those of the latter have risen nearly 26 per cent to Rs 216. The 30-share Sensex has added 56.40 per cent during the same period.

Global brokerage Jefferies is bullish on ITC with a price target of Rs 265. “Given the Covid-related concerns, we find consumer staple firms relatively better placed given the defensive nature of the business. Businesses with strong cash flows and robust balance sheets may be preferred during this period of disruption,” it said.

The fund house further raised its holdings in outperformers such as Sun Pharmaceuticals, GAIL (India), The Federal Bank, Jamna Auto, Hindalco, Vedanta, Lupin, HCL Technologies, Rain Industries and HAL, among others. Shares of these companies have gained 55-155 per cent since April 1.

Meanwhile, the fund house sold more than 1 crore shares each in ICICI Bank, Ambuja Cement, Tata Steel, PNB and Power Grid and offloaded more than 50 lakh shares each in BPCL, NHPC, NTPC and SBI.

Sectorwise, the fund house bought additional 1 lakh shares of Bank of Baroda and IDFC First Bank from the banking space. In auto, it picked more than 13,000 shares of Bajaj Auto, 60,000 shares of Maruti Suzuki and 2.46 lakh shares of Mahindra & Mahindra.

Bharti Airtel, GHCL, United Spirits, Siemens, DLF, Endurance Technologies, Phoenix Mills, Transport Corporation of India, Cadila Healthcare, Bharat Dynamics, The Great Eastern Shipping, Adani Ports, Radico Khaitan, Mishra Dhatu Nigam, Mphasis, Titan and L&T Technology Services are among other stocks where HDFC AMC bought 1-5 lakh additional shares in November.

Of late, realty stocks have been on the radar of investors and analysts. “While demand is recovering in some pockets on a low base, we believe absorption and supply at the industry level will remain subdued and cash flow issues will worsen,” Edelweiss Securities said in a report.

It said developers with strong brand reputations and low leverage are best placed to survive the turmoil.

Overall, HDFC AMC raised exposure to at least 76 stocks during the month, but cut it in 92 others, data available with Ace Mutual Fund showed. Some of this buying or selling may have been done for the AMC’s passively-managed index funds.

In the broader market, the fund house completely exited Bata India, Colgate-Palmolive, Nalco, Nila Infra and VIP Industries. Its fresh buys during the month included Ashok Leyland, Dabur India, Mindspace Business Park REIT, Sun TV Network, The Ramco Cement and Torrent Power.

Ambit Capital is positive on Ashok Leyland with a price target of Rs 128. “Among the commercial vehicles (CV) OEMs, we prefer Ashok Leyland to Tata Motors, as the former is a pure-play domestic CV maker with a cleaner balance sheet, lower capex needs and facing limited competitive intensity. Though Ashok Leyland has moved up about 80 per cent in last six months, we believe it is just the initial rally for a four-year extended upcycle after around 70 per cent decline during FY20-21E,” Ambit said. It also has ‘buy’ ratings on Maruti Suzuki with a price target of Rs 8,677."
HDFC,"Dec 15, 2020, 07:56 AM IST",HDFC MF converts closed-end fund into open-ended,"HDFC Mutual Fund is converting its underperforming Housing Opportunities Fund (HOF) - Series 1--the industry's largest equity closed-ended fund with assets of Rs 3088 crore-- into an open-ended scheme just a month before its maturity. This means the product will continue to function without any lock-in or restrictions and new investors will be allowed to put in fresh money. Investment advisors are recommending existing investors to exit the product because of its underperformance.

HDFC HOF Series 1 was launched as a close-ended fund in November 2017, with a tenure of 1440 days, which ends on January 18, 2021.Investment advisors said the renewed buzz around real estate and housing activities might have promped the fund to open up.

 “Unit holders may note that no action is required in case they are in agreement with the changes proposed to the Scheme. The offer to exit from the Scheme is optional at the discretion of the Unit holders and not compulsory. We would like you to remain invested in the Scheme,” said the notice to investors by HDFC Mutual Fund. Existing Unit holders of the Scheme are provided with an option to exit at the prevailing NAV, without exit load, from December 18, 2020 to January 18, 2021if they do not wish to stay invested in the Scheme pursuant to the aforesaid changes.

Existing investors, who have been locked into the scheme for three years, have made losses with the fund losing an annualized 1.14% in the past three years.

“Compared to peer groups, the fund has been a poor performer,” says Vineet Nanda, Founder, Sift Capital. ""Investors could move out to quality funds to improve their portfolio returns.""

Financial planners believe three years is a long time given that the fund has been investing in a wide range of sectors and investors could move out.

“It is hard to believe that a scheme will perform now, if it did not do so for the last three years,” says Vidya Bala, Co-Founder, Primeinvestor.in

With interest rates on housing loans at a four-decade low, real estate prices falling, and the government making housing a priority, some analysts believe the environment for housing has changed and investors should not exit at a loss.

 “Thematic funds are risky bets and take time to play out. Risk takers who believe GDP growth will pick up in the coming year and are eyeing a theme which is yet to play out could continue to stay invested here,” says Anup Bhaiya, MD and CEO, Money Honey Financial Services."

HDFC,"Dec 11, 2020, 11:00 AM IST",Stocks that helped these PMSes make big money for HNIs in Nov,"NEW DELHI: A spectacular bull run on Dalal Street helped domestic portfolio managers for the rich deliver solid returns to their high networth clients in November. Available data suggests at least 189 major PMSes from across segments – like multicap, smallcap, midcap and largecap – delivered positive returns to investors during the month.

Lake Water Advisors’ Multicap Strategy delivered the most at 30.12 per cent for November, 62.17 per cent for last six months and 13.65 per cent for last one year. Nearly 67 per cent of the portfolio is invested in five stocks: Bajaj Finance, Aarti Industries, L&T Technology Services, 3M India and Aarti Surfactants.

Trivantage Capital Management’s Super Six gained 24.80 per cent last month, while Basant Maheshwari Wealth Advisers’ Equity Fund advanced 22.04 per cent.

Super Six holds Bajaj Finance, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Life Insurance, Credit Access Grameen and Axis Bank.

Trivantage Capital Management’s Resurgent Financials gained 19.90 per cent in November, but is down 3.90 per cent for last one year, data available with PMSBazaar showed.

BSE benchmark Sensex soared 11 per cent to around 44,150 last month, backed by firm global cues, sustained inflows from foreign institutional investors and hope of Covid vaccine. The broader BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices each climbed over 13 per cent to 16,914 per cent and 16,975 per cent, respectively.

A Balasubramanian, CEO of Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, says HNIs may now come back to midcaps and smallcaps.

“The TINA (there is no alternative) factor is there, given the fact that interest rates are so low, real estate as a segment is still not a space where you can put all your money and thus equity as an asset class has come back. That is why I think HNIs will come back and participate in the broader market and that could lead to midcaps and smallcaps doing well,” he said.

BSE Smallcap and Midcap indices currently trade at 13 per cent and 4 per cent discount to their respective all-time highs of January 2018.

Among the other top gainers, Credent Asset Management’s Growth Portfolio and Capgrow Capital Advisors’ Special Situations Scheme gained 21.75 per cent and 21.10 per cent, respectively.

Credent Asset Management’s Growth Portfolio had maximum 17.61 per cent weightage to the financial sector, followed by healthcare services (10.05 per cent), information technology (7.36 per cent), chemicals (5.10 per cent) and construction material (2.65 per cent). On the other hand, Special Situations has given maximum weightage to hospitals (22.30 per cent), BFSI (19.90 per cent) and consumer (13.50 per cent).

Fortis Healthcare, Engineers India, Aditya Birla Capital and Indiabulls Real Estate were among the major holdings of Capgrow’s Special Situations Scheme last month.

Marcellus’ Little Champs (up 17.30 per cent), Tata PMS’ Emerging Opportunities(up 17.03 per cent), Ambit’s Emerging Giants (up 16.30 per cent), Buoyant Capital’s (up 16.20 per cent), Capgrow Capital Advisors’ Growth (up 15.70 per cent), Aditya Birla Money’s Core & Satellite Portfolio (up 15.64 per cent) and India Consumption Portfolio (up 15.46 per cent), ASK’s Growth (up 15.40 per cent) and IEP (up 15.10 per cent) also delivered robust alpha to their clients.

As of November 30, Ambit’s Emerging Giants held midcap and smallcap stocks including DCB Bank, Garware Technical Fibres, Can Fin Homes, Amrutanjan Healthcare, Cera Sanitaryware, Greenlam Industries, Hawkin Cookers and Ultramarine & Pigments.

Aditya Birla Money’s Core & Satellite held stocks like Bajaj Finance, Aarti Industries, Dalmia Bharat, Maruti Suzuki, Eicher Motors, HDFC Bank and Phoenix Mills, among others.

ASK Growth and IEP portfolios had Bajaj Finance, Divi’s Labs, Bajaj Finserv and Aarti industries among their top holdings.

“Going ahead, the value theme is expected to recover and perform better. Sectoral leadership changes with every crisis. Therefore, one should invest in potential future leaders through high conviction ideas. One should also aim to benefit from the wealth creation opportunities in the smallcap and midcap segments,” fund house ICICI Prudential said in a note."
HDFC,"Dec 10, 2020, 08:18 AM IST",Life insurers hit the first big hurdle since June,"Mumbai: A slow month of business from state-owned insurance behemoth Life Insurance Corp of India (LIC) has led to growth of new business premiums (NBP) for the life insurance industry recording a fall in November after four straight months of strong growth.

Latest data from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) showed that the NBP in November for life insurers came at ₹19,159 crore against ₹26,221 crore in the same period last year, recording a fall of 27%. The industry had recorded a 32% growth in NBP in the month of October.

NBP is the premium acquired from new policies in a year and is a metric to gauge business growth.

LIC’s NBP declined more than 35% to ₹12,092.66 crore against ₹18,770 crore in the same period last year, the data showed. Meanwhile, private insurers saw their NBP fall by 5.15 % to ₹7,066.65 crore.

According to a note by Kotak Institutional Equities, private sector players Aditya Birla Life and ICICI Prudential had a “weak” month in individual APE (annual premium equivalent), whereas HDFC Life, Max Life and Tata AIA performed better than the industry. SBI Life and Bajaj Life were broadly in line with industry averages, it added.

Individual APE for the private sector declined 7%, while group APE was down 12% — around 7% decline in overall APE.

“This may be due to a high base effect; November 2019 was a strong month for the private industry with 27% growth as compared to 3-4% growth in September and October 2019,” according to Kotak Institutional Equities.

For the listed insurers, HDFC Life saw its total premium collection in the month of November dropping by 11%, ICICI Pru's November APE fell by 30%. Max Life’s November premium grew by 13%, the data showed, while SBI Life’s premium grew by 3.4% in the reporting period.

“In November ’20, Max Life grew by 8% YoY in terms of Individual Adjusted FYP, making us one of the top players with a positive outlook when the private industry de-grew by 7%,” said Prashant Tripathy, MD, Max Life Insurance.

“The steady uptake of protection products and customers’ growing focus towards securing the future of their loved ones during uncertain times have acted as catalysts,” he added.

According to experts, a lower base in FY22 due to the impact of the lockdown on the sales of life insurance products could paint a better picture for the industry."

Can you suggest which funds shall I add/switch to? Can these funds get me a return of 20-25% per annum on my overall investment over a period of 20 years? 

– Varun Bansal 

Ashish Modani, Founder, SLA Financial Solutions, responds:

Let me do some maths based on your expectations. You want to invest Rs 56,000 per month over next 20 year and expecting a return of 20-25%. It means, you would invest around Rs. 1.34 crore and you are expecting around Rs 17 crore @20%, and Rs 37 crore @ 25% returns. 

 The point, is it possible to get such high returns? Well, return on investment largely depends on how underlying economy will perform over long period rather than the funds. In my view, over next decade or so, as we expect Indian economy to grow much bigger and move from developing to developed nation, returns probably would be lesser than what they were in last 20 years. Also, rather than focusing on high returns on investments and investing when markets are lower, it would be better to increase your investments by spending less or by reducing you future requirements. 

As far as fund selection is concerned, it is very difficult to predict what will be the return from these funds over 20 years. The darlings of mutual fund investors 20 years ago are not even talked about today. Every successful fund has gone through times of extreme bad times. Often, investors tend to show interest in funds which have done well in the recent past and leave those which had bad performance. 

In all the funds you have picked up, all had phases of bad performances in the course of their journey. Everyone talks about PPFAS Long term Equity and Franklin Feeder Fund today because of as their performance is great as the US market has grown in last three years or so. Not many people were talking about them three years ago.

Base your investments on your goals and maintain an asset allocation for achieving those goals. Rather than focusing on what you cannot control (fund performances, return etc.), its best to focus on what you can control like restricting your current expenses so that you can increase your savings and maintaining an asset allocation. Review your portfolio once in a year or maximum twice in a year. Take decisions, based on your situation and your portfolio rather than market situation and best performers."

HDFC,"Dec 08, 2020, 07:44 AM IST","Business improving, fresh loan slippages unlikely: ICICI Bank","Mumbai: ICICI Bank, India’s second-most valued lender after HDFC Bank, told analysts that business is beginning to look up and fresh slippages are unlikely to be significant as the majority of the bad loans had already been identified before the lockdowns began to prevent the Covid-19 pandemic from spreading.

Separately, the lender also told analysts that technical outages are an unfortunate but harsh reality in an increasingly digital banking landscape, Macquarie Capital said in a report that captured the outcome of the management's meeting with analysts. 

ICICI Bank’s comments on system outages follow the recent central bank curbs on further expansion of digital services at HDFC Bank, where web and online services faced some disruptions. Macquarie Capital said that since many of the bad loans had already been accounted for in the previous cycle, the bank is now left with a more resilient corporate portfolio.

“Hence, the pandemic hasn’t affected their portfolio much and they clearly guided for restructured assets to be sub 1%,” said Suresh Ganapathy, associate director, Macquarie Capital, who posted a note on the ICICI Bank analysts’ meet. “They are also seeing renewed optimism in corporate banking and their recent interactions with corporates indicate that some corporates are more optimistic now than they were pre-Covid and this should lead to a revival in capex.”

Steel, cement, and pharma supply chains would be the key sectors driving capex. However, capex will still be initially led by the government and PSUs, Ganapathy added. 

The bank also told analysts that the corporate loan book grew 1.3x in the last two years. 

“As per the management, it would be incorrect to say that growth in the corporate banking loan book has been low as reported numbers also include non-performing loans. In fact, originations (direct + funds raised through DCM division) in the performing corporate loan book grew 1.3x in the last two years,” Ganapathy said in his note. 

On system outages in light of an enhanced share of digital banking, the ICICI Bank management told analysts that banks will try and minimise the probability of such events. It hosted its analyst day to showcase its digital capabilities around each of its business verticals.

 Meanwhile, ICICI Bank is focusing on transforming its role from ‘provider of capital’ to that of a partner providing dealer vendor solutions and reducing working capital cycles. That will help the corporates increase their top-lines and the focus of the bank has been to capture the entire ecosystem through 360-degree banking, Ganapathy said."
HDFC,"Dec 07, 2020, 08:14 PM IST",ICICI Bank opens up its mobile app for customers of rival lenders,"MUMBAI: At a time when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has tightened scrutiny over digital services offered by banks in light of increased instances of outages, private sector lender ICICI Bank has upgraded its mobile app to allow customers of rival banks to avail basic online banking services on its platform. 

The new app, which ICICI Bank claims is a first in the industry, will allow users to link their bank accounts, generate a UPI ID and avail services such as online transactions, opening savings accounts, making investments, applying for loans and credit cards without being an ICICI Bank account holder. 

The lender in a statement said that it aims to “extend the ambit of mobile banking apps which are hitherto restricted to only the customers of the respective banks.”

Anup Bagchi, the executive director at the bank said that the new initiative will allow customers to avail “benefits of banking and payment apps in one single place” instead of having multiple such apps on their smartphones.

“In the recent past, we have captured two user insights while interacting with them. One, many of them, who are not our customers, are keen to use iMobile (ICICI Bank App). Two, customers are tired of using multiple apps…Now on, customers of any bank can experience the ease, speed and safety of our mobile banking app,” he added.

The move comes just days after RBI’s temporary sanctions on rival lender HDFC Bank to launch new digital initiatives and source new credit card customers noting instances of multiple mass outages in mobile banking services in recent years, amid intensifying scrutiny by the regulator on technological vulnerabilities in India's banking system.

According to Dilip Asbe, the CEO of National Payments Corp of India, the initiative “will inspire the ecosystem to integrate interoperability on digital platforms...The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is known to provide seamless, secure and convenient payment experience to its users…,” he said."

Last week, the Reserve Bank of India had asked HDFC Bank to halt launches of all new digital offerings and stop onboarding credit card customers.

HDFC,"Dec 04, 2020, 08:56 PM IST",Former HDFC Bank MD Aditya Puri’s family buys Rs 50 crore apartment in Malabar Hill,"MUMBAI: Former HDFC Bank Managing Director Aditya Puri’s family has bought a Rs 50-crore apartment in South Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill locality. Puri’s wife Anita Puri and daughter Amrita Puri have jointly purchased this nearly 5,000 sq ft sea-view luxury house next to Raj Bhavan on Walkeshwar Road.

The family has paid Rs 1 crore as the stamp duty for the property’s registration that was executed on November 25, showed documents accessed by ET.

Puri joined the US-based global investment firm the Carlyle Group as a senior advisor in November after retiring from HDFC Bank in October.

The family has bought the apartment on the 19th floor of Lodha Seamont and has got access to 7 car parks as part of the deal.

Aditya Puri could not be reached immediately for a response.

Luxury apartments in south and south-central Mumbai, an area that was saddled with supply, has been witnessing a sharp pickup in sales in the last few months, providing relief to developers who were struggling to offload inventory after Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the real estate market.

A reduction in stamp duty by the government of Maharashtra, festive offers, ready stock and minimal impact of Covid-19 on its target buyers helped boost sales in this upscale area.

The Maharashtra government had reduced stamp duty to 2% from 5% till December-end and 3% between January and March 2021 in a bid to encourage home sales.

According to property brokers, the pandemic’s impact on clientele for such properties has been limited and these prospective buyers are largely scouting for ready homes or those nearing completion.

These micro markets are known for their proximity to business hubs and traditional luxury pin codes of south Mumbai. These also house many high-profile names including industrialists, sports people, start-up founders and C-Suite professionals, and therefore the preference of this buyer segment continues to be in favour of the micro market."

The index formed higher highs and lows for the fifth session in a row, signalling a bullish bias.

It needs to hold above 13,100 level to witness a bounce towards 13,400 level, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities. ""On the downside, major support exists in the 13,000 level,"" he said.

For the day, Nifty closed at 13,258, up 124.65 points or 0.95 per cent.

""The short-term trend continues to be bullish. But the index is trading at the rising channel on the weekly chart. Traders are advised to maintain a bullish bias, but not to trade highly leveraged or aggressive bets. Soon a mild dip can trigger profit taking. A break below the 12,900 level can be taken as a warning signal of a short-term decline,” said Nirali Shah, Senior Research Analyst at Samco Securities.

Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities, said Nifty50 saw sharp gains on a weekly basis after a sluggish market movement in the past couple of weeks.

""The confusing Doji pattern on the weekly chart was negated on Friday, as Nifty50 closed above last week's high of 13,145. This could be seen as sign of strength in the upside momentum after the breakout of the long-term resistance of uptrend line (connected from top-to-top weekly timeframe). This is a positive signal and more upside could be expected in the coming weeks,” Shetti said.

""As the market under the firm control of the bulls, if Nifty sustains above the 13,152 level in the next session, it can push the index towards the next target at 13,320 level. Beyond that, a higher target of 13,550 cannot be ruled out. If Nifty trades below 13,150 level for the major part of next session, intraday weakness can creep in and drag the index down towards 13,100 level initially,” said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia .in."
HDFC,"Dec 04, 2020, 04:54 PM IST","Not a tangled web we must weave, RBI tells banks & their proxies","The window to banking is now as wide as the worldwide web – so vast that protecting new-gen customers transacting online could soon tell success from failure in an industry that, for centuries, thrived on networking behind closed doors.

With banking taking on an increasingly digital accent each passing day, Mint Road is now buttressing standards around grievance resolution and customer protection to ensure continued confidence in the burgeoning virtual channels that are crucial for financial inclusion.

“Lakhs of internet banking customers cannot be put under distress,” central bank governor Shaktikanta Das said Friday, underscoring the need to strengthen both banking technology systems - and their supervision.

“The financial sector is becoming increasingly IT dependent and requisite investments by banks and NBFCs are necessary,” Das said. “We are constantly engaging with the entities around deficiencies…as the apex regulator of the banking and payment systems, certain action becomes unavoidable.”

He also added that the drastic step to freeze all digital expansion initiatives and credit card sourcing by HDFC Bank on Thursday was necessitated due to “earlier episodes (of outages) and overwhelming presence” the private lender commands in India’s digital banking and payments ecosystem.

“(Whether to impose) monetary penalty or take supervisory action differs” from one case to another, Das said in response to a question on whether the action taken against India’s most valuable lender would become the norm. 

“In the HDFC (Bank) case, due to earlier episodes and overwhelming presence in the internet banking segment, we have concerns around these deficiencies. We have asked them to strengthen IT systems before further clearances. We are certain the bank will comply,” Das added.

The regulator's action follows the bank's inability to fix the problem despite formal instructions over the past few years. It is learnt that the regulator had raised the issue with the bank during its periodic inspections as lakhs of customers and the payments systems were being put at risk because of such interruptions.

The governor also indicated that the central bank will soon publish a new draft framework around the supervisory and regulatory standards for banks to ensure better grievance resolution and consumer protection systems.

“These directions will contain requirements for robust governance, implementation and monitoring of certain minimum standards on common security controls for channels like internet and mobile banking, card payments,” Das said.

Additionally, in the way of policy action to enhance contactless transactions, the central bank also relaxed limits on tap and go payments to Rs 5,000 from the current Rs 2,000.

""This is a welcome step by RBI to increase transactions and e-mandate limit,"" said Dilip Asbe, CEO, NPCI.
""The increased limit will also help to boost the average value of transaction and push the adoption of digital payments.""

The move comes after several representations made by card networks such as Visa and Mastercard.

“As evident in recent months, there is strong consumer preference for digital payments and the new enhanced limits for e-mandates and contactless cards will help transition millions of Indian consumers from cash to fast, convenient and secure forms of digital payments,” said T R Ramachandran, group country manager, India & South Asia, Visa.

The move was also accompanied by easing of norms around e-mandate and everyday settlement of transactions through key National Payments Corporation of India operated channels such as UPI, AePS, RuPay and IMPS. 

“With this enablement, it is proposed to reduce settlement and default risk in the system by facilitating settlement of AePS, IMPS, NETC, NFS, RuPay, UPI transactions on all days of the week. This will make the payments ecosystem more efficient,” Das said in his speech.

He also said that a central bank team is probing outages faced by State Bank of India’s mobile application platform."

 The MACD signalled a bias on the counter. The MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the signal line, is plotted on top of the MACD to reflect ""buy"" or ""sell"" opportunities.

Dr. Reddys,"Dec 16, 2020, 12:06 PM IST","MFs sold 80% of Nifty stocks in Nov, but grabbed remaining 10","NEW DELHI: Mutual funds were seen paring stakes in 80 per cent of the Nifty50 stocks in November, the month that saw these institutional investors selling Rs 30,760 crore worth of shares on Dalal Street.

Bajaj Finserv, IndusInd Bank, Nestle India and Tata Steel were among the stocks that saw biggest drops in MF holdings, while Adani Ports, Dr Reddy's Labs and HCL Technologies were among a few that saw buying by the desi fund managers during the month.

One of the stocks that saw the biggest selloff by MFs was Bajaj Finserv. Mutual fund holding in terms of number of Bajaj Finserv shares held by 19 mutual funds declined 18.9 per cent during the month to 46 lakh shares.

Mutual funds' total holding in the stock was valued at Rs 4,060 crore at the end of the month, a study by Motilal Oswal Securities showed.

In the case of IndusInd Bank, the number of shares MFs held in the bank fell 16.7 per cent month-on-month to 5.21 crore shares. MF holding on this counter stood at Rs 4,470 crore at the end of the month.

MFs sold 13 per cent of their holdings in Nestle India; 12.8 per cent of their holdings in Tata Steel and 10.3 per cent in Tech Mahindra. Hero MotoCorp, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Britannia Industries, Divi’s Labs, Hindalco Industries, Bajaj Finance, Eicher Motors and NPTC were among the stocks where mutual funds trimmed their stakes in excess of 5 per cent.

""In March, there was a record outflow from FPIs and record buying by domestic institutional investors. If I have to choose a time to invest, I would always choose March over November. If my investors are booking profit, so be it. At lower levels, I will be a buyer rather than a seller. Having said that, November, like October and September, saw profit booking by our clients. We have seen redemptions by people who were in financial need,” said Nilesh Shah of Kotak AMC.

Shah said it is not that fund managers are selling because they find the market expensive. Rather, it’s because investors are redeeming. “Our cash levels remained virtually stagnant over the last eight-nine months,"" he said. 

Redemptions by MF investors rose 26.7 per cent month-on-month (MoM) in November to Rs 28,100-odd crore while sales of equity schemes fell 18.4 per cent MoM to Rs 14,900 crore. This led to the highest ever net outflows of Rs 13,200 crore from mutual funds. 

AgenciesThe handful of stocks that saw buying by these funds during the month included Adani Ports, Dr Reddy's Labs, HCL Tech, Grasim, Maruti Suzuki, UPL, M&M, SBI, Sun Pharma and Coal India.

Mutual funds increased the number of shares they hold in Adani Ports by 7 per cent to 7.73 crore. Eighteen mutual funds owning less than 2 per cent stake in Adani Ports had Rs 3,180 crore worth of exposure in the Adani Group company.

In Dr Reddy's Labs, holdings of 20 mutual funds rose by 5.2 per cent MoM to 2.09 crore shares. In HCL Tech, MF holding rose by 4.8 per cent to 16.98 crore shares. Maruti Suzuki saw MF holding rise 4.3 per cent to 2.36 crore shares. In Grasim, they held 1.7 per cent more shares than in October. UPL saw over 1 per cent rise in the number of shares the MFs held in the company.

M&M, SBI, Sun Pharma and Coal India were some of the companies that saw MF buying during the month.

""Reasons of the selling could vary from risk-profiling to valuation concerns.

Post Thursday’s fall, Nifty defended levels of 11,700 and rallied till 12,892. Eventually, the Nifty managed to settle in the positive territory for the third straight week. There seems to be an appearance of multiple peaks near 12,950 levels. Even as per options data, the level of 13,000 needs to be surpassed to regain required momentum on the upside. While on the flip side, sustenance below 11,800 could attract mild correction till 12,700-12,650 zone.

After marking a low of 28,581, the Bank Nifty recovered till 29,407. However, it failed to surpass Thursday’s peak. Inability to provide positive follow-up action could attract some price consolidation.

Pfizer filed the possiblepatentinfringementcase against Aurobindo Pharma in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and Dr Reddy's in the New Jersey court. Palbociclib is used to treat a certain type of breast cancer and works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells.
Ibrance clocked nearly USD five billion revenues globally including USD 3.25 billion in the USA in 2019, according to Pfizers 2019 annual report. 

In March 2019, several generic companies notified us that they had filed abbreviated new drug applications with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking approval to market generic versions of Ibrance.

The generic companies assert the invalidity and non- infringement of two composition of matter patents and a method of use patent covering palbociclib, each of which expire in 2023, according to the annual report. Pfizerin its petition stated that the Indian drug makers had submitted abbreviated new drug application(ANDA) to the USFDA seeking approval to engage in commercial manufacture, sale and importation of the intended generic drugs of ibrance capsules, 75 mg, 100 mg, and 125 mg prior to the expiration of the 730patent.

Pfizer sought among others apreliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Aurobindo and DRL, from commercial manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, or importation of the ANDA products, or any other drug product covered by 730 patent into the US, prior to expiration of that patent, including any extensions and additional period of exclusivity.

UnderParagraph IVPatentCertifications, a company can seek FDA approval to market a generic drug before the expiration ofpatentsrelated to the branded medicine that the pharma company seeks to copy.

Acity-based pharmaceutical company senior official said patentlitigationcases are not uncommon for generic drug makers in the USand thelawsuit will not have any implications on the performance of the company."

Bajaj Finance,"Dec 17, 2020, 10:36 AM IST",These Nifty stocks hit record highs this week. Can they add to gains?,"MUMBAI: As benchmark Nifty ruled at a record high on Wednesday, six of its components scaled all-time highs this week. Here’s a quick look at these top performers, and what has driven them up.


Adani Ports and SEZ: The Adani Group stock scaled a record high, as analysts upped their price targets on the private multi-port operator, on the back of a faster-than-expected turnaround in its recently acquired Krishnapatnam Port. The stock has gained 30 per cent year to date, and is up more than 134 per cent from its March lows.


Bajaj Finance: With Bajaj Finance shares ruling at record high levels, investors are now anxious if this multibagger will continue the uptrend. However, the stock has seen fatigue set in after multiplying nearly three times from its March lows. The Sensex stock had tumbled more than 50 per cent in March, when the onset of Covid-19 pandemic rattled markets, and had tumbled to a 52-week low of Rs 1,783.10 on May 27. Since then, it has risen nearly 3 times.


Kotak Mahindra Bank: This private lender scaled a record high on Wednesday, performing gradually but consistently on the bourses. Earlier this week, RBI approved the re-appointment of Uday Kotak as the bank’s Managing Director for a further period of three years. The stock is up 16 per cent for the year to date, and has recovered more than 95 per cent from its March lows.


Titan: Big Bull Rakesh Jhunjhunwala’s prized possession Titan has hit a record high, buoyed by robust festive season sales, and as investors preferred industry leaders in a market where valuations have entered the expensive zone. The stock is up 27 per cent year to date, and has more than doubled from its 52-week low hit in March.


Asian Paints: The country’s top paint maker has been true to its multibagger tag, and has been hitting new highs. At the start of second half of 2020, the stock started recovering on the back of pentup demand after the lockdown curbs eased. Amit Syngle, MD & CEO told ETNow that sustainable new demand has emerged. The stock has gained 45 per cent for the year to date, and is up more than 80 per cent from March lows.


Nestle India: The fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firm logged new highs, riding the wave of urban as well as rural demand. The stock is up 24 per cent year to date, and is up more than 50 per cent from its March lows."
Bajaj Finance,"Dec 16, 2020, 10:31 AM IST","After 3-fold rise since March, will this multibagger run out of steam?","MUMBAI: As Bajaj Finance shares ruled at record high levels, investors have turned anxious if this multibagger can continue its uptrend or develop fatigue after growing nearly three times from their March lows.

Bajaj Finance on Tuesday crossed the Rs 3 lakh crore mark in market capitalisation for the first time, as the stock of the country’s largest non-banking finance company (NBFC) hit a record high in an otherwise lacklustre market.

The stock scaled a record high of Rs 5,152 on Tuesday, and its market-cap hit the Rs 3.09 lakh crore mark.

The Sensex stock had tumbled more than 50 per cent in March, when the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic rattled the market across the board. It hit a 52-week low of Rs 1,783 on May 27. Since, the stock has multiplied nearly 3 times.

It has been a consistent performer on the bourses, and is up 7,456 per cent over the past decade. The stock has logged gains in 16 of last 19 calendar years since 2000, and has doubled investor wealth every six years.

Bajaj Finance is engaged in lending and allied activities, and focused on consumer lending, small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) lending, commercial lending, rural lending, fixed deposits and value-added services.

As of Tuesday, December 15, the stock had 6 ‘strong buy’, 5 ‘buy’, 9 ‘hold’, 5 ‘sell’ and 3 ‘strong sell’ ratings on the publicly available Reuters Eikon database.

On December 1, ICICIdirect came out with a buy rating on the stock, and raised the price target to Rs 5,900 from Rs 3,850 earlier.

“Bajaj Finance has sailed through the headwinds and emerged stronger with a leaner operating model and robust growth guidance,” ICICIdirect analysts said.

They pointed out that RBI’s new banking licence review has recommended that large NBFCs with more than Rs 50,000 crore assets with at least 10 years’ existence can apply for banking licence.

“Also, the company management’s comment to consider the same bodes well for a long-term view on the stock. The NBFC’s ~25 per cent growth guidance for FY22E and the opportunity to apply for a banking licence have resulted in renewed investor interest in the stock,” the brokerage said.

A robust and consistent performance has made the stock an attractive bet for some.

Mahantesh Sabarad, Head of Retail Research at SBI Capital Markets, said he does not have a rating on the stock at this point of time, but pointed out that the economic recovery may lead to good growth in consumer financing. “The stock valuations appear stretched, as Bajaj Finance does not have a directly comparable peer that can match its performance, which makes it very attractive for investors to hold,” Sabarad said.

However, the recent rally in the stock has raised concerns for many. “I am concerned about the quality of the retail book. One should be booking profits at this point,” said independent analyst Ambareesh Baliga.

“With strong flows from FIIs (foreign institutional investors), there are very limited stocks where their money is getting in, and Bajaj Finance has been one of them,” he said.

That seems to be the concern for others too.

“More than 700 FIIs hold the stock. When there is risk-on trade and liquidity is pouring in, such stocks naturally grab attention due to the sheer size, management quality and past performance,” said Abhimanyu Sofat, head of research at IIFL Securities.

Currently, as many as 727 FIIs own 21.31 per cent stake in Bajaj Finance.

“However, the stock trades at a price to book of more than 8 times, and such valuations definitely look stretched. On the retail side, the NPA pain is still persisting,” he said.

For the quarter ended September, Bajaj Finance posted 35.94 per cent year-on-year drop in net profit at Rs 964.88 crore, which lagged analysts’ estimates. Thanks to the ongoing pandemic, the company further increased its provisions on Stage 1 and 2 assets by Rs 1,370 crore to Rs 5,099 crore as of September 30.

Sofat, who had a ‘buy’ rating on the stock until now, says he would now rate it at ‘hold’ after the recent runup."
Bajaj Finance,"Dec 16, 2020, 07:18 AM IST","Bajaj Finance continues surge, market cap tops Rs 3 lakh crore","Mumbai: The market value of Bajaj Finance crossed Rs 3 lakh crore for the first time on Tuesday as the share price of the NBFC hit a record high in an otherwise lacklustre market.

The stock ended up 4.7 per cent at Rs 5,128.05 after hitting a record high of Rs 5,152.85 during the day. It closed the session with a market cap of Rs 3.1 lakh crore.

The stock had tumbled to a low of Rs 1,783.10 on May 27 as financials took a hit for a longer period than the benchmarks which had hit a bottom on March 24. Shares of Bajaj Finance have surged nearly three times since then.

“Investors are looking for strong businesses and Bajaj Finance is one of the highly-rated NBFCs. Fall in borrowing costs has improved the outlook on NBFCs,” said Lalitabh Shrivastawa, associate vice-president (research) at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

Morgan Stanley said in a recent note that the stock is primarily driven by the management’s confidence around its asset quality position and provisioning levels that it has guided for the ongoing financial year. The certainty around the asset quality should also shorten the timeline of returning to strong loan growth, said Morgan Stanley, raising the target price to Rs 5,625 from Rs 3,835.

“The stock has had a sharp run and might take a breather in the near term. However, we remain constructive on healthy returns over a one-year period given improving macro and a supportive liquidity environment,” said Morgan Stanley."

The session saw Nifty forming a small positive candle on the daily chart with a long lower shadow, which could be considered as the formation of another Doji pattern, signaling further up move in the short term.

Market barometer Sensex edged up 9.71 points to close at 46.463.17 points, while peer Nifty, too, advanced 9.70 points to 13,567.85.

In stock specific movement, Bajaj Finance crossed the Rs 3 trillion mark in terms of market capitalization, while Burger King jumped another 20 per cent after a spectacular debut in the previous session.

“We’re seeing consolidation in the index on the expected lines but the bias is still on the positive side. A decisive break above 13,600 in Nifty could further fuel the rally. However, on the flip side, the breakdown below 13,400 may induce the participants to reduce positions,” said Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking.

It would be interesting to see which of these bigger entities blink first. RBI may make regulation for them tighter as proposed by deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao recently -- at par with banks -- given their systemic importance. 

None of the top non banking finance companies (NBFC) had shown eagerness to grab the “on-tap license” opportunity that is available since 2016, perhaps because they enjoy the regulation-light structure while banking rules are far more stringent.

NBFCs are allowed to apply for a banking licence provided the promoters meet the fit and proper criteria. Those include a 10-year track record of successful operations, but there is a restricting clause saying that non-financial business of the promoter group must not exceed 40 per cent of the group’s total assets/total income.

The RBI working group has now built a case for relaxing the first-level entry filter and encouraging large NBFCs to become a bank with an aim to “reduce chances of regulatory arbitrage”. The group suggested that they be given a glide path for compliance with norms as applicable to banks.

“Well-run large NBFCs, with an asset size of Rs 50,000 crore and above, including those which are owned by a corporate house, may be permitted to convert to banks, provided they have completed 10 years of operations,” the working group proposed.

On the issue of large NBFCs converting into banks, almost all the experts were of the view that large NBFCs, with good track record, should be encouraged to convert into a bank as this will result in better regulations of these entities.

Some of the experts were of the view that for corporate promoted large NBFCs that may be eyeing banking licences, either the corporates should bring down their stake to 10% or the bank should be properly ring fenced with the non-financial activities of the promoter group, through prescription of group exposure limits.

“The concerns relating to direct ownership of banks by large corporate/industrial houses may get mitigated in respect of the NBFC route as increasingly, several elements of the prudential framework for banks have already been extended to some of the large NBFCs in view of their systemic importance,” the group said."

BHARTI AIRTEL
Market cap: Rs 2,62,630 cr
CMP: Rs 481
Bought by HDFC MF
There are four immediate triggers which have convinced analysts and managers alike regarding the attractiveness of Bharti Airtel. Analysts say that the company will be the biggest beneficiary of recovery in average revenue per user as a result of tariff hikes and increasing migration to 4G services of customers from 2G services. Besides, the company has a better balance sheet than its peers. Analysts are also impressed with the fact that the company has constructed more towers and mobile stations in the September 2020 quarter in comparison with the previous quarter. Lastly, the company received the approval to increase FII ownership limit to 100% from 49%. Given this, analysts expect 5-16% in the company’s Earnings per Share (EPS) for the next two fiscals.

Besides, the company’s increasing presence in the healthcare sector is expected to boost its order book and topline in a meaningful way. In the September 2020 quarter, the company’s margins have improved by 180 bps to 17.8%. In the coming quarters, these deals will further improve margins. In the context of these deals, analysts expect 15-30% growth in its earnings per share for the next two fiscals.

The scrip, which has no ‘sell’ call as of today, has been a consistent performer, rallying 23-132 per cent annually in nine out of last 11 years. The stock’s performance has been poor this year by its own standard: it had earlier dropped 17 per cent in 2013 and 7 per cent in 2011.

While concerns persist over the slow recovery of Bajaj Finance, analysts find comfort in the good show of the company's insurance JVs. The stock had seven 'buy', two 'outperform' and one 'hold' ratings in the publicly available with Reuters' Eikon database last week.


Company background
Bajaj Finserv is the holding company for Bajaj Group businesses dealing with financial services. It has 52.74 per cent stake in Bajaj Finance that itself has two fully-owned subsidiaries -- mortgage lender Bajaj Housing Finance and broking and depository firm Bajaj Financial Services.

Bajaj Finserv also holds 74 per cent stake each in insurance joint ventures Bajaj Allianz General Insurance (BAGIC) and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance (BALIC).


Q2 earnings
The Bajaj group firm reported an 18 per cent drop in consolidated profit for September quarter at Rs 986.30 crore against Rs 1,203.7 crore reported for the same quarter last year. The numbers were hit partly by Bajaj Finance's Rs 541 crore expected credit loss provision. Revenue for the quarter rose 6 per cent to Rs 15,051.60 crore from Rs 14,224.20 crore YoY. Asset under management rose 1 per cent to Rs 1,37,090 crore from Rs 1,35,533 crore YoY.

Among different businesses, the general insurance JV reported Rs 332 crore profit for September quarter, life insurance JV Rs 98 crore and NBFC Bajaj Finance Rs 965 crore.


Management commentary
Bajaj Finserv says the pandemic-linked lockdown imposed by the government impacted the group’s business operations considerably. It resulted in significantly lower business acquisition and hurt recovery of dues from customers, it added.

New loans booked by Bajaj Finance fell to Rs 36.2 lakh from Rs 64.7 lakh, which was more than double of the June quarter number. The general insurance arm’s gross written premium was marginally lower due to a drop in sales of commercial vehicles insurance, travel insurance and tenders for the government health business, but underwriting results were quite strong, Bajaj Finserv said.

The life insurance business JV was able to record 19 per cent growth in individual rated new business premium and delivered growth in new business value (NBV), the company said.


What do analysts say…
Edelweiss Securities said Bajaj Finserv reported soft results largely due to lower profitability in lending by Bajaj Finance and the life insurance arm. The insurer held up well due to improvement in underwriting performance, it said.

NBFC Bajaj Finance cut its FY21 AUM growth guidance to 6-7 per cent from 10-12 per cent earlier, even as it kept credit cost guidance unchanged at 4-4.1 per cent. Disbursements stood at 62 per cent of last year’s volume. The moratorium percentage fell to 8 per cent from 15.7 per cent.

Nomura India said Bajaj Finance’s business momentum clearly lagged frontline banks, with slow growth recovery seen even in September – urban B2B business grew to 72 per cent, auto finance to 54 per cent and B2C, SME and mortgages to 54 per cent of last year’s levels.

In the case of the insurance arm, while underwriting performance was strong, the lower investment income pulled down profit growth to 13 per cent.

The insurance arm’s partnerships with Axis Bank, Bandhan Bank, RBL Bank and India Post Payments Bank worked and led to outperformance in individual new business premiums. The demand for protection and high margin non-par guaranteed saving products remained strong and led to a favourable shift in the business mix, analysts said.

“The insurance subsidiaries are delivering well, with BAGIC delivering higher underwriting profits (adjusted for seasonality) and growth drags reducing. BALIC also delivered well on growth, with 19 per cent YoY individual APE growth and 290 basis points YoY rise in net VNB margin improvement in the first six months of the year,"" Nomura said.

APE stands for annual premium equivalent, and VNB for value of new business.


Valuations
JM Financial sees the stock at Rs 8,670, which suggests about 50 per cent upside over current market price. It expects Bajaj Finance to enter FY22 on a very strong footing, owing to highest capital level within the sector, a strong balance sheet, structurally higher profitability driven by permanent cost savings, and continued improvement in the liability profile.

“Bajaj FinServ’s insurance businesses are strong franchises and are likely to continue focus on selective underwriting and high-margin businesses,” it said.

Kotak said the encouraging performance of insurance subsidiaries creates upside potential to its targets. Bajaj Finance still accounts for 67 per cent of Bajaj Finserv's sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuations.

“Bajaj Finserv remains our preferred vehicle to play Bajaj Finance. The insurance players are adding a layer of icing,” it said, as it increased its price target to Rs 8,000 from Rs 7,600. This price target suggests 40 per cent upside from Monday's closing level.

The brokerage valued the BAGIC business at four times book value, which is lower than 4.7 times book value for ICICI Lombard. It sees BALIC at 1.4 times embedded value (EV), which is 2-3.8 times the EV of matured listed peers. For Bajaj Finance, Kotak assigns 3.8 times FY22 book .

“The recent underperformance has turned the valuations attractive. Hence, we maintain our ‘Hold’ call. Moreover, we do not alter our target multiple for respective businesses and price targets remain unchanged at Rs 7,200. The evolving dynamics of Bajaj Finance’s asset quality and growth resumption will primarily determine the stock’s performance,” Edelweiss said.

Rich valuations for Bajaj Finance at four times September 2022 book value restricts upside for Bajaj Finance, Nomura India said.

“However, we see value coming from the insurance business, and a holding company discount over 50 per cent for the lending business does provide much better risk-reward. This brokerage has a price target of Rs 7,550 on the stock,” the brokerage said."

Bajaj Finance,"Oct 26, 2020, 05:32 PM IST","When interest rates are low, how to make money in the fixed income space?","NEW DELHI: Mortgage lender HDFC has just reduced deposit rates on medium-term investments to the lowest in 43 years. Deposit rates on a 66-month investment fell 20 basis points to 6.25 per cent from 7.75 per cent a year ago, reflecting the squeeze on returns in fixed income assets.

Falling returns on fixed income assets have created a conundrum for risk-averse investors and retired employees, who fall back on such products to generate regular income. In a high inflationary environment, such low returns on assets tend to erode capital and, thus, dwindle the asset base.

However, wealth advisers say it’s not really a hopeless situation, and the fixed income space still offers a plethora of attractive investment options. Just that one needs to walk through a labyrinth to figure out which product suits one’s needs and risk profile best. The right investment option can make one a lot of money, while the wrong one can spell disaster.


Which product suits you?
So, which fixed income product can help you make money in the current environment of low interest rates, increased default risks and ever more importance of cash?

Wealth advisers say it all depends on your individual income-tax slab. “A lot of choices in the fixed income space will depend on the tax bracket an individual investor falls. While high quality corporate deposits or bank deposits or even postal savings schemes are good options for people in the lower tax bracket; tax-free bonds, short-term debt funds and dynamic debt funds can be better alternatives for people in higher tax brackets,” said Vishal Dhawan, Founder & CEO of Plan Ahead Wealth Advisers.


Don’t lose sight of common options
Dhawan said investors who are not using their tax exemption limits in public provident fund (PPF), voluntary provident fund (VPF) and Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana to take a serious look at these products. “They provide returns in the vicinity of 8 per cent currently, but have lock-in periods,” he said.

These long-term schemes run by governments and financial institutions are extremely safe, provide superior returns and come with multiple tax benefits.


Investment mantra: Safety first
Wealth advisers say safety of investment is of paramount importance in fixed income assets, so one should not run after more returns just for the sake of it.

“The main objective for investing in fixed income assets is to avoid risks. Sometimes people get tempted with something that may give one per cent extra return, but they do not evaluate the risk involved in chasing that extra return. If you do not understand a risky investment tool, it's best to sacrifice that extra return and be in products that will get keep your money safe,” said Lovaii Navlakhi, Founder and CEO, International Money Matters. 

Navlakhi recommends a conservative approach, given the uncertain economic situation, and advises people to invest in corporate debt funds, which hold mostly AAA-rated papers for shorter term. Those with a longer time horizon can look at G-Sec, he said.


Count your tax slab
Cash flow or immediate need for cash are important, and hence, the options may vary for salaried investors and retired people.

“For a person with a job, generating an income is not the key concern. So, it will depend on the income-tax slab, as FDs and small savings schemes may not be suitable for those in the higher tax slab. I would suggest select debt funds for them. If the person is elderly, my suggestion will be Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana and Senior Citizen Savings Scheme,” said Suresh Sadagopan, Founder & Principal of Ladder7 Financial Advisories.

For those with a shorter investment horizon, Sadagopan recommends only mutual funds. “An arbitrage fund or a shorter tenure fund can give slightly better pre-tax returns. Moreover, they also have greater liquidity than bank FDs,” he said.

“Typically, I would avoid products where taxation will be at the income-tax slab level. Because for someone in the 30 per cent tax bracket, 7 per cent return on a bank FD will result in less than 5 per cent real return,” Sadagopan said.


Bear with inflation for now
As RBI is doing all it can to keep interest rates low even as inflation, which eats into your money’s worth, has hit an eight-month high of 7.34 per cent, bank fixed deposits have become unattractive. But analysts say one should not be discouraged by that.

“Inflation, which is there currently, may not be at the same level once the base effect comes in early next year. So, while bank FDs may not be inflation-beating today, that reality may soon change. Therefore, investment decisions should not be made looking at the current inflation rate. People should keep in mind to not lower the quality of a portfolio trying to get higher interest rates. It is still not advisable to take higher risk to get higher return. If a mutual fund has higher exposure to lower-rated bonds or credit risks, it is not worth taking that higher risks,” Dhawan said. 


What about corporate FDs?
For a person who wants to move beyond bank FDs, does it make sense to go for corporate fixed deposits, which give better returns. Analysts say, “Yes, but there is a caveat.”

“You can invest as long as you understand the risks in corporate deposits. Just because a company is rated higher or has been in the business for many years, it may not be good enough. It will be important to see which industry it belongs to and how has been its business growth in these challenging times, because ultimately it will have an impact on the deposits and deposit rates,” said Navlakhi.

Dhawan advises investors to stick to high quality AAA-rated paper in the corporate FD space. Top rated companies like HDFC, Mahindra Finance, Bajaj Finance and LIC Housing Finance are offering returns in the 5.5-7.5 per cent range on deposits for one year, which is more than the 5 per cent returns that top banks are offering on FDs currently.

Corporate deposit schemes run a default risk, which has heightened in the wake of the pandemic, as companies go through severe stress.

“The risk in fixed income comes from single ownership. Single instruments, single company and single sector-focused fund managers are at risk. If I put my money in one company, say ILFS, I either get zero return or all. So if you are putting your money in corporate deposits, make sure the amount is not so much that it can impact you gravely if there is a delay or payment default,” said Navlakhi.


Three things to avoid
Suresh Sadagopan advised investors to avoid the following things in the current environment:



Do not chase fads: When gold prices were going up, everyone was chasing the yellow metal. If you really want to create wealth, asset allocation has to be in place, you cannot keep on running behind what is doing well.


Don’t dwell too much on returns: Safety of money is more important right now than what returns you are getting. It is not worth taking that extra risk for an additional buck.


Ensure liquidity level: Keep the liquidity intact in banks for emergencies; don’t trust every investment product to stay liquid all the time."

Bajaj Finance,"Oct 22, 2020, 11:47 AM IST","Bajaj Finance falls out of analysts’ favour as AUM, profit growth suffer","NEW DELHI: Most analysts on Dalal Street were disappointed by the September quarter earnings report announced by Bajaj Finance and see the stock performance to suffer in tandem with declining profits.

The NBFC on Wednesday posted a 35.94 per cent year-on-year drop in net profit at Rs 964.88 crore for the September quarter, missing Street estimates by a good margin. Consolidated assets under management (AUM) increased marginally by around 1.15 per cent.

“With AUM growth further toned down, provisioning requirements remaining elevated and overhang of flexi loans, FY21 will be a washout year. Though MoM improvement is visible, competition from banks is stiff. We will be watchful of on the ground developments to check for any upside risk on growth,” said analysts at Axis Capital.

They valued the stock at 5.4times FY21 and 4.5 times FY22 adjusted book value, and said this does not offer room for appreciation with current fundamentals. They recommend selling the stock with a target at Rs 2,900, a potential downside of 10 per cent.

Analysts at Kotak Securities also advised reducing holdings in the company saying even though the business is recovering in expected lines, positives are already priced in.

“Bajaj Finance’s performance seems to be broadly tracking its guidance with likely bottoming out of loan book, building adequate buffers for the year and control over expenses. The company may be well-placed for a normalized FY22 unless slippages disappoint. All the positives, however, are already reflected in the current valuations, prompting us to await better entry points,” the brokerage said.

Kotak Securities has a target of Rs 3,000 for Bajaj Finance. This translates into a downside of over 7 per cent from the previous closing price.

Investors, however, were unperturbed by bearish brokerage commentary as shares of the company rose 1.54 per cent to Rs 3,283.10 in Thursday’s trade. Though, this buying comes on the back of about a per cent fall in share prices on Wednesday after earnings announcement.

The company management’s strategy is clear. They want to focus on wading through the crisis before focusing on growth. It has now one of the highest provisions earmarked to battle bad loans and has trimmed AUM growth guidance for FY21 from 10-12 per cent to 6-7 per cent.

This has also given hopes to some analysts, who believe in the long run, the company may benefit from its conservative strategy.

Analysts at Nirmal Bang said the company is frontloading provisions in FY21 but high growth will return in FY22. The broker has ‘accumulate’ rating on the scrip with target price at Rs 3,564, which means a potential upside of 10 per cent.

Motilal Oswal and Antique Stock Broking have similar views but they do not see much appreciation in the stock price given near term growth woes and lofty valuations. Both see 5 per cent potential upside from current prices."

UltraTech Cem.,"Dec 07, 2020, 12:59 PM IST",26% jump in a month! This stock has just cemented its prospects with a massive capex plan,"MUMBAI: Massive expansion plans, coupled with a pickup in activity in rural India, and plans to reduce debt have driven the stock of this cement maker to an all-time high, and analysts believe there is scope for further gains.

The company is UltraTech Cement.

On December 4, the stock jumped as much as 6.3 per cent to climb an all-time high of Rs 5,198, as the company unveiled its capacity expansion plan. The stock has risen nearly 26 per cent in last one month. The stock has delivered 21 per cent return for last one year, 24 per cent for three, 78 per cent for last five and 360 per cent for last 10 years.

The Sensex stock is among the most preferred names of analysts, and had 21 ‘strong buy’ and 16 ‘buy’ ratings in the Reuters Eikon database last week. It also had 2 ‘hold’ and one ‘sell’ ratings.

On Thursday, the flagship cement company of the Aditya Birla Group announced a Rs 5,477 crore investment on a mix of greenfield and brownfield capacity expansion to add additional capacity of 12.8 million tonne per annum. This comes as the first major investment of this size by a cement maker in recent years.

Given its pan-India presence, which will be further strengthened by capacity expansion, UltraTech will be well-positioned to support the rising demand for cement in the country, the company said.

The expansion would include existing approval for a cement plant at Pali in Rajasthan, in addition to the company’s 6.7 mtpa capacity expansion currently under way in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar and West Bengal, which has picked up pace and is expected to be commissioned in a phased manner by FY22.

On December 4, Kotak Institutional Equities maintained an ‘add’ rating on the stock and raised its price target to Rs 5,250 from Rs 4,900 earlier.

“The growth rate is in line with our expectation of industry growth and the company’s past growth rates. The expansion is at an attractive $57 per tonne,” Kotak analysts said in a note.

They said the management remains committed to become (net) debt free by FY2023E and is upbeat on the industry’s demand prospects, more so for the eastern region.

The company’s second quarter report card was impressive. UltraTech Cement reported a 113 per cent jump in September quarter net profit at Rs 1,234 crore. Net sales rose 7.8 per cent to Rs 10,231 crore from Rs 9,486 crore. The company reported robust operating margins at 27 per cent, driven by both revenue growth and tight cost management.

HDFC Securities maintained a ‘buy’ rating on the stock, with a price target of Rs 5,670, and said the company expects to spend Rs 6,530 crore on this 19.5 million tonne expansion.

“The capex rate is low (Rs 3.4 billion per million tonne), owing to brownfield expansion accounting for ~50% of it, and lower clinker expansion. We expect these expansions to get fully commissioned by 1QFY24E and bolster UTCEM’s volume growth visibility FY24 onwards,” HDFC analysts said in a note on December 4.

“We continue to like UltraTech Cement for its robust margin outlook and debt reduction,” they said.

Prabhudas Lilladher maintained a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 5,400, and said UltraTech enjoys one of the best earnings quality in the cement space, led by high trade share and efficient operations.

“Strong fundamentals of the (eastern) region and near bottomed out margins augur well for the expansion with the aided advantage of low capex cost and superior logistics. Rest of the expansion is dedicated to attractive markets in north and central India,” PL analysts said in a December 4 note."

UltraTech Cem.,"Oct 22, 2020, 12:22 PM IST",Analysts see up to 24% upside in this cement stock after an impressive Q2,"NEW DELHI: Superior growth in volume and realisations; check. Cost cutting; check. Selling non-core assets to focus on core business; check. Substantial reduction in debt; check.

The management of UltraTech Cement delivered on all parameters during the September quarter cheering analysts and investors alike. Brokerages raised their earnings estimates and target price on the stock following the cement maker's earnings report.

Krupal Maniar, an analyst at ICICI Securities, said the company displayed strong overall execution and is ripe for a rerating. “With better profitability, UltraTech Cement is likely to become debt free by FY23 and improve return ratios by 300-500bps over FY20-FY23. Factoring-in Q2FY21 beat, we raise our target price to Rs 5,725 per share from earlier Rs 5,100,” he said.

Maniar has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a potential upside of 24 per cent, and values it at 13 times Sep’22 EV/E on half-yearly rollover.

UltraTech Cement reported a 113 per cent jump in its net profit at Rs 1,234 crore for the quarter. Net sales of the company rose 7.8 per cent to Rs 10,231 crore with robust operating margins at 27 per cent.

The company also shaved off Rs 4,728 crores of net debt in the first-half of this fiscal year with a reduction of Rs 2,209 crore during the quarter ended June and rest during the September quarter.

Motilal Oswal said the company continues to deliver and de-lever (attributing to debt reduction) and hence raised earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 4-6 per cent. It has a target of Rs 5,600, meaning a potential upside of 21 per cent from last close.

The business outlook is also quite promising, believes the management. They see demand to rise given the government's focus on infra projects and Reserve Bank of India’s recent steps to encourage activity in real estate sectors.

“Cement pricing has already started strengthening in October and if demand recovery sustains pricing could gain further momentum in Q4FY21. Given its leadership pan-India positioning, the company remains in a sweet spot to benefit from industry demand recovery,” said Prateek Kumar, a research analyst at Antique Stock Broking.

He has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with target at Rs 5,450 as he increased Ebitda estimates for FY21 by 16 per cent and FY22 by 10 per cent.

“Earnings were significantly higher than estimates led by outperformance across parameters – volumes, realizations and costs. Lower capex, working capital reduction and divestments of non-core assets have accelerated deleveraging in H1FY21,” analysts at Kotak Securities said. They warned that cost inflation could impact margins in the second half of the financial year, though it should be partly offset by operating leverage and higher prices."

HDFC Life,"Dec 11, 2020, 11:00 AM IST",Stocks that helped these PMSes make big money for HNIs in Nov,"NEW DELHI: A spectacular bull run on Dalal Street helped domestic portfolio managers for the rich deliver solid returns to their high networth clients in November. Available data suggests at least 189 major PMSes from across segments – like multicap, smallcap, midcap and largecap – delivered positive returns to investors during the month.

Lake Water Advisors’ Multicap Strategy delivered the most at 30.12 per cent for November, 62.17 per cent for last six months and 13.65 per cent for last one year. Nearly 67 per cent of the portfolio is invested in five stocks: Bajaj Finance, Aarti Industries, L&T Technology Services, 3M India and Aarti Surfactants.

Trivantage Capital Management’s Super Six gained 24.80 per cent last month, while Basant Maheshwari Wealth Advisers’ Equity Fund advanced 22.04 per cent.

Super Six holds Bajaj Finance, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Life Insurance, Credit Access Grameen and Axis Bank.

Trivantage Capital Management’s Resurgent Financials gained 19.90 per cent in November, but is down 3.90 per cent for last one year, data available with PMSBazaar showed.

BSE benchmark Sensex soared 11 per cent to around 44,150 last month, backed by firm global cues, sustained inflows from foreign institutional investors and hope of Covid vaccine. The broader BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices each climbed over 13 per cent to 16,914 per cent and 16,975 per cent, respectively.

A Balasubramanian, CEO of Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, says HNIs may now come back to midcaps and smallcaps.

“The TINA (there is no alternative) factor is there, given the fact that interest rates are so low, real estate as a segment is still not a space where you can put all your money and thus equity as an asset class has come back. That is why I think HNIs will come back and participate in the broader market and that could lead to midcaps and smallcaps doing well,” he said.

BSE Smallcap and Midcap indices currently trade at 13 per cent and 4 per cent discount to their respective all-time highs of January 2018.

Among the other top gainers, Credent Asset Management’s Growth Portfolio and Capgrow Capital Advisors’ Special Situations Scheme gained 21.75 per cent and 21.10 per cent, respectively.

On the other hand, Special Situations has given maximum weightage to hospitals (22.30 per cent), BFSI (19.90 per cent) and consumer (13.50 per cent).

Fortis Healthcare, Engineers India, Aditya Birla Capital and Indiabulls Real Estate were among the major holdings of Capgrow’s Special Situations Scheme last month.

As of November 30, Ambit’s Emerging Giants held midcap and smallcap stocks including DCB Bank, Garware Technical Fibres, Can Fin Homes, Amrutanjan Healthcare, Cera Sanitaryware, Greenlam Industries, Hawkin Cookers and Ultramarine & Pigments.

ASK Growth and IEP portfolios had Bajaj Finance, Divi’s Labs, Bajaj Finserv and Aarti industries among their top holdings.

“Going ahead, the value theme is expected to recover and perform better. Sectoral leadership changes with every crisis. Therefore, one should invest in potential future leaders through high conviction ideas. One should also aim to benefit from the wealth creation opportunities in the smallcap and midcap segments,” fund house ICICI Prudential said in a note."

HDFC Life,"Nov 03, 2020, 11:19 AM IST",Some of India’s biggest post-Covid money spinners hit valuation hurdle,"Half the listed entities owned by billionaire Gautam Adani have made money for equity investors so far in 2020. As a result, Adani’s own net worth has soared by $12.40 billion in a year when the Covid pandemic has wreaked havoc with the economy and industry.

With $23.7 billion net worth, Adani is the second richest individual in the country behind RIL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh Ambani ($77.7 billion), according to Bloomberg Billionaire Index.

On an average, Adani group’s six listed entities have surged 76 per cent till date, while BSE benchmark Sensex has retreated 4 per cent.

On top of the chart, the Adani Green Energy stock has rallied 414 per cent to Rs 856 year-to-date (YTD), while Adani Enterprises and Adani Gas have gained 63 per cent and 35 per cent, respectively.

“Specific Adani companies such as Adani Green, Adani Gas and Adani Transmission are in a high capex cycle for next three to five years. These companies will reap very high market shares with sufficient cash flows over the next 5-10 years. Adani Ports is also progressing well,” said Sameer Kalra, Founder, Target Investing.

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) in October announced the completion of the acquisition of Krishnapatnam Port Company for an enterprise value of Rs 12,000 crore.

There are hopes that the acquisition will accelerate APSEZ’s stride towards its goal of reaching 500 million tonnes per annum capacity by 2025. ICICI Securities is positive on Adani Ports with a price target of Rs 430.

“Adani Port has been consolidating between Rs 310 and Rs 360 over the past four months. However, delivery volumes have hit a five-month high as the stock recovered from lower support. We believe buying interest is increasing on the counter,” the brokerage said.

Amid the ongoing momentum in Adani Green Energy, the firm’s market capitalisation is now hovering around Rs 1.34 lakh crore. This makes it India’s 21st biggest entity in terms of market value after Nestle, Axis Bank and Avenue Supermarts.

Companies like Titan, Sun Pharmaceuticals, HDFC Life Insurance, Larsen & Toubro and UltraTech Cement have a market-caps between Rs 1 lakh crore and Rs 1.33 lakh crore.

“The acquisition of Mumbai International Airport is one of the major triggers for the Adani group. This reflects the group’s long-term strategic plan amid the Covid crisis. Adani Gas, Adani Green, Adani Power and Adani Ports are into promising businesses and are likely to have improved margins in years to come,” said Jaiprakash Gupta, Director and CEO, Moneylicious Securities.

On the other hand, stocks such as Adani Ports, Adani Power and Adani Transmission have declined 1.70 per cent, 42 per cent and 12 per cent, respectively, year to date.

Adani group of companies posted a mixed set of numbers for the June quarter. Adani Enterprises reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 65.67 crore against a Rs 570.14 crore profit posted for the corresponding quarter last year. Adani Power, too, reported a loss of Rs 682 crore against Rs 263 crore loss reported for the same quarter a year ago.

Adani Green reported Rs 20 crore profit against Rs 98 crore loss YoY. Net profit of Adani Gas declined 41 per cent to Rs 46.33 crore and that of Adani Ports by 26 per cent YoY to Rs 759 crore, respectively. Adani Transmission’s bottom line increased 67 per cent YoY to Rs 355 crore.

Gupta says these stocks are a bit stretched in terms of valuation now. “It is advisable to wait for some correction to set in even in Adani group stocks. Investors with long-term investment horizon can use any correction to accumulate these stocks, preferably Adani Gas,” he said.

In terms of valuation, the majority of Adani shares are not in the comfort zone. Adani Green is available at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 502 times against its long-term average of 348 times. Adani Enterprises is hovering at a P/E of 250 times against a long-term average of 96 times. Adani Gas trades at 60 times against its long-term averaged of 52 times, while Adani Ports quotes a P/E value of 42 times against 26 times.

“Money is chasing momentum. As a result, significant buying is pushing select Adani group stocks higher amid a favourable business environment. I will prefer to wait for the valuations to come down,” said Kranthi Bathini, Equity Strategist, WealthMills Securities.

Latest shareholding data revealed that foreign portfolio investors held 22.43 per cent stake in top performer Adani Green as of September 30 against 21.52 per cent in the quarter ended June 30. Mutual funds increased their holding to 0.09 per cent from 0.01 per cent and high net worth individuals (HNI) to 0.96 per cent from 0.91 per cent. On the other hand, retail investors marginally cut their holding to 1.09 per cent from 1.43 per cent.

Investors are showing huge interest in the Adani Green stock, as it has a perfect pitch for ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) focused investors, Bathini said."

Overnight rally in US markets helped boost sentiments but high level of volatility in the market is worrying. Analysts advise investors to be cautious and be stock-specific in buying.


Factors driving markets

Record covid cases: There has been a record surge in Covid-19 infections in Europe and the US. Global coronavirus cases rose by over 500,000 for the first time and France and Germany prepped fresh lockdowns.


US tech firms beat estimates: Wall Street had a solid session overnight, which was helped by a diet of strong quarterly reports from tech giants. Google parent Alphabet, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc and Facebook Inc all beat analyst estimates for quarterly revenue, with Amazon reporting a second straight quarter of record profits.


US grows at record pace: The US economy grew at a historic annualised pace of 33.1 per cent in the third quarter as the government injected more than $3 trillion worth of pandemic relief which fuelled consumer spending, but the effects of the Covid-19 recession is likely to linger for longer.


ECB to take action: The European Central Bank committed to take new action in December to contain the growing fallout from a second wave of coronavirus infections, likely in the form of more bond purchases or cheap credit for banks.

Here's what brokerages recommend,"New Delhi: Brokerages hold a mixed view on HDFC Life Insurance Company after the private insurer on Monday reported a 5.64 per cent growth in standalone net profit at Rs 326.09 crore for the quarter ended September 30.

The scrip traded 0.20 per cent higher at Rs 571.80 at around 11 am (IST), while the benchmark BSE Sensex was up 175 points, or 0.43 per cent, at 40,606.

Edelweiss Securities has ‘Reduce’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 530, while Motilal Oswal Financial Services is ‘Neutral’ on the company and set a price target at Rs 625. On the other hand, YES Securities has ‘Add’ rating with a target of Rs 620.

Edelweiss said, “Valuations are a legacy of sustained higher margin or growth than competition along with brand benefits. An optimal business mix with non-par products’ share of around 30 per cent is a long-term positive, but a short-term margin headwind. At present, valuations fully capture the growth spurt.”

On a consolidated basis, HDFC Life’s net profit stood at Rs 327.83 crore in the reporting quarter as against Rs 308.98 crore a year ago. Its net premium income was Rs 10,045.44 crore, as compared to Rs 7,453.68 crore earlier.

The insurer’s first-year premium stood at Rs 1,675.15 crore as against Rs 1,452.72 crore on a year-on-year basis.

According to YES Securities, the savings business has gathered momentum in Q2 FY21 and is likely to sustain given that the propensity to save is increasing amongst customers. Protection business will continue to witness strong demand on the back of lower penetration and current environment.

“HDFC Life with a balanced product mix and strong distribution channel is well poised to sustain its strong growth trajectory in premiums. Profitability is also expected to improve going ahead with favourable product mix and scale benefits,” YES Securities said."

HDFC Bank,"Dec 08, 2020, 07:44 AM IST","Business improving, fresh loan slippages unlikely: ICICI Bank","Mumbai: ICICI Bank, India’s second-most valued lender after HDFC Bank, told analysts that business is beginning to look up and fresh slippages are unlikely to be significant as the majority of the bad loans had already been identified before the lockdowns began to prevent the Covid-19 pandemic from spreading.

Separately, the lender also told analysts that technical outages are an unfortunate but harsh reality in an increasingly digital banking landscape, Macquarie Capital said in a report that captured the outcome of the management's meeting with analysts. 

ICICI Bank’s comments on system outages follow the recent central bank curbs on further expansion of digital services at HDFC Bank, where web and online services faced some disruptions. Macquarie Capital said that since many of the bad loans had already been accounted for in the previous cycle, the bank is now left with a more resilient corporate portfolio.

“Hence, the pandemic hasn’t affected their portfolio much and they clearly guided for restructured assets to be sub 1%,” said Suresh Ganapathy, associate director, Macquarie Capital, who posted a note on the ICICI Bank analysts’ meet. “They are also seeing renewed optimism in corporate banking and their recent interactions with corporates indicate that some corporates are more optimistic now than they were pre-Covid and this should lead to a revival in capex.”

Steel, cement, and pharma supply chains would be the key sectors driving capex. However, capex will still be initially led by the government and PSUs, Ganapathy added. 

The bank also told analysts that the corporate loan book grew 1.3x in the last two years. 

“As per the management, it would be incorrect to say that growth in the corporate banking loan book has been low as reported numbers also include non-performing loans. In fact, originations (direct + funds raised through DCM division) in the performing corporate loan book grew 1.3x in the last two years,” Ganapathy said in his note. 

On system outages in light of an enhanced share of digital banking, the ICICI Bank management told analysts that banks will try and minimise the probability of such events. It hosted its analyst day to showcase its digital capabilities around each of its business verticals.

 Meanwhile, ICICI Bank is focusing on transforming its role from ‘provider of capital’ to that of a partner providing dealer vendor solutions and reducing working capital cycles. That will help the corporates increase their top-lines and the focus of the bank has been to capture the entire ecosystem through 360-degree banking, Ganapathy said."
HDFC Bank,"Dec 07, 2020, 08:14 PM IST",ICICI Bank opens up its mobile app for customers of rival lenders,"MUMBAI: At a time when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has tightened scrutiny over digital services offered by banks in light of increased instances of outages, private sector lender ICICI Bank has upgraded its mobile app to allow customers of rival banks to avail basic online banking services on its platform. 

The new app, which ICICI Bank claims is a first in the industry, will allow users to link their bank accounts, generate a UPI ID and avail services such as online transactions, opening savings accounts, making investments, applying for loans and credit cards without being an ICICI Bank account holder. 

The lender in a statement said that it aims to “extend the ambit of mobile banking apps which are hitherto restricted to only the customers of the respective banks.”

Anup Bagchi, the executive director at the bank said that the new initiative will allow customers to avail “benefits of banking and payment apps in one single place” instead of having multiple such apps on their smartphones.

“In the recent past, we have captured two user insights while interacting with them. One, many of them, who are not our customers, are keen to use iMobile (ICICI Bank App). Two, customers are tired of using multiple apps…Now on, customers of any bank can experience the ease, speed and safety of our mobile banking app,” he added.

The move comes just days after RBI’s temporary sanctions on rival lender HDFC Bank to launch new digital initiatives and source new credit card customers noting instances of multiple mass outages in mobile banking services in recent years, amid intensifying scrutiny by the regulator on technological vulnerabilities in India's banking system.

According to Dilip Asbe, the CEO of National Payments Corp of India, the initiative “will inspire the ecosystem to integrate interoperability on digital platforms...The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is known to provide seamless, secure and convenient payment experience to its users…,” he said."

HDFC Bank,"Dec 07, 2020, 12:12 PM IST","ICICI Bank tells analysts technical outages can happen anytime, banks can only reduce probability","MUMBAI: Chiming in support of peer HDFC Bank, private lender ICICI Bank has told analysts that technical outages are an unfortunate but harsh reality and can happen anytime, a report by Macquarie Capital has revealed. The ICICI bank management also told analysts that the only thing a bank can do is minimise the probability of such events, Macquarie has said. 

Last week, the Reserve Bank of India had asked HDFC Bank to halt launches of all new digital offerings and stop onboarding credit card customers. This is the first time the regulator has imposed business sanctions on a bank for a system outage, indicating a strict stance here on for similar episodes. 

ICICI bank recently hosted its analyst day where the bank showcased their digital capabilities around each of their business verticals and their continued focus to partner with the customers across the entire ecosystem. 

Meanwhile the private lender sounded optimistic on its asset quality and growth prospects despite the pandemic. The bank told analysts that since much of the corporates which had to turn bad have turned bad in the previous cycle, the bank is now left with a more resilient corporate portfolio.

“Hence the pandemic hasn’t affected their portfolio much and they clearly guided for restructured assets to be sub 1%,” said Suresh Ganapathy, associate director, Macquarie Capital, who posted a note on the ICICI Bank analyst meet. “They are also seeing renewed optimism in corporate banking and their recent interactions with corporates indicate that some corporates are more optimistic now than they were pre-covid and this should lead to a revival in capex.”

Steel, cement, and pharma supply chain would be the key sectors driving capex. However, capex will still be initially led by government and PSUs, Ganapathy added. 

The bank also told analysts that the corporate loan book grew 1.3x in the last two years. 

“As per the management, it would be incorrect to say that growth in the corporate banking loan book has been low as reported numbers also include non- performing loans. In fact, originations (direct + funds raised through DCM division) in the performing corporate loan book grew 1.3x in the last two years,” Ganapathy said in his note. 

ICICI Bank is focusing on transforming its role from ‘provider of capital’ to that of a partner providing dealer vendor solutions, reducing working capital cycle which ultimately helps the corporates to increase their top line and thus the focus has been to capture the entire ecosystem through 360-degree banking, Ganapathy said."
HDFC Bank,"Dec 07, 2020, 04:09 PM IST",Moody’s now has a negative view on HDFC Bank,"MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) directions on HDFC Bank due to multiple outages in its internet banking, mobile banking and payment services in the last two years are credit negative for the bank and it will delay the launch of new digital initiatives and could likely increase spending which will strain the bank's profitability, global credit rating agency Moody's said in a report.

""The RBI action will delay the launch of HDFC Bank's Digital 2.0 initiative, under which the bank aims to consolidate all customers' digital transactions, including payments, savings, investments, shopping, trade, insurance and advisory services, into one platform. This has the potential to increase spending to improve the bank's digital infrastructure, which would strain its profitability,"" Moody's said.

On December 3, the RBI asked the bank to temporarily stop all launches under its Digital 2.0 initiative and stop sourcing new credit card customers. The regulator's response came after the bank experienced multiple outages in its internet banking, mobile banking and payment utility services over the past two years. 

HDFC Bank is rated at Baa3 Negative in line with India's sovereign rating. Moody's said the regulators' action is credit negative because the bank is increasingly relying on digital channels to source and service its customers. 

""The recurring outages also risk hurting the bank's brand perception among a growing and increasingly digitally savvy customer base, and increases the potential that clients switch to other banks, which would lead to a reduction in revenue and low-cost retail funding,"" Moody's said but added that it does not expect the regulators' action to materially affect the bank's existing business and financial profile. 

HDFC Bank, the second-largest bank in India by deposits and is the market leader by value of digital transactions processed for April to September 2020 with a 20% share ahead of SBI according to RBI data analysed by Moodys.

HDFC Bank,"Dec 04, 2020, 08:56 PM IST",Former HDFC Bank MD Aditya Puri’s family buys Rs 50 crore apartment in Malabar Hill,"MUMBAI: Former HDFC Bank Managing Director Aditya Puri’s family has bought a Rs 50-crore apartment in South Mumbai’s plush Malabar Hill locality. Puri’s wife Anita Puri and daughter Amrita Puri have jointly purchased this nearly 5,000 sq ft sea-view luxury house next to Raj Bhavan on Walkeshwar Road.

The family has paid Rs 1 crore as the stamp duty for the property’s registration that was executed on November 25, showed documents accessed by ET.

Puri joined the US-based global investment firm the Carlyle Group as a senior advisor in November after retiring from HDFC Bank in October.

The family has bought the apartment on the 19th floor of Lodha Seamont and has got access to 7 car parks as part of the deal.

Aditya Puri could not be reached immediately for a response.

Luxury apartments in south and south-central Mumbai, an area that was saddled with supply, has been witnessing a sharp pickup in sales in the last few months, providing relief to developers who were struggling to offload inventory after Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the real estate market.

A reduction in stamp duty by the government of Maharashtra, festive offers, ready stock and minimal impact of Covid-19 on its target buyers helped boost sales in this upscale area.

The Maharashtra government had reduced stamp duty to 2% from 5% till December-end and 3% between January and March 2021 in a bid to encourage home sales.

According to property brokers, the pandemic’s impact on clientele for such properties has been limited and these prospective buyers are largely scouting for ready homes or those nearing completion.

These micro markets are known for their proximity to business hubs and traditional luxury pin codes of south Mumbai. These also house many high-profile names including industrialists, sports people, start-up founders and C-Suite professionals, and therefore the preference of this buyer segment continues to be in favour of the micro market."
HDFC Bank,"Dec 04, 2020, 04:54 PM IST","Not a tangled web we must weave, RBI tells banks & their proxies","The window to banking is now as wide as the worldwide web – so vast that protecting new-gen customers transacting online could soon tell success from failure in an industry that, for centuries, thrived on networking behind closed doors.

With banking taking on an increasingly digital accent each passing day, Mint Road is now buttressing standards around grievance resolution and customer protection to ensure continued confidence in the burgeoning virtual channels that are crucial for financial inclusion.

“Lakhs of internet banking customers cannot be put under distress,” central bank governor Shaktikanta Das said Friday, underscoring the need to strengthen both banking technology systems - and their supervision.

“The financial sector is becoming increasingly IT dependent and requisite investments by banks and NBFCs are necessary,” Das said. “We are constantly engaging with the entities around deficiencies…as the apex regulator of the banking and payment systems, certain action becomes unavoidable.”

He also added that the drastic step to freeze all digital expansion initiatives and credit card sourcing by HDFC Bank on Thursday was necessitated due to “earlier episodes (of outages) and overwhelming presence” the private lender commands in India’s digital banking and payments ecosystem.

“(Whether to impose) monetary penalty or take supervisory action differs” from one case to another, Das said in response to a question on whether the action taken against India’s most valuable lender would become the norm. 

“In the HDFC (Bank) case, due to earlier episodes and overwhelming presence in the internet banking segment, we have concerns around these deficiencies. We have asked them to strengthen IT systems before further clearances. We are certain the bank will comply,” Das added.

The regulator's action follows the bank's inability to fix the problem despite formal instructions over the past few years. It is learnt that the regulator had raised the issue with the bank during its periodic inspections as lakhs of customers and the payments systems were being put at risk because of such interruptions.

The governor also indicated that the central bank will soon publish a new draft framework around the supervisory and regulatory standards for banks to ensure better grievance resolution and consumer protection systems.

“These directions will contain requirements for robust governance, implementation and monitoring of certain minimum standards on common security controls for channels like internet and mobile banking, card payments,” Das said.

Additionally, in the way of policy action to enhance contactless transactions, the central bank also relaxed limits on tap and go payments to Rs 5,000 from the current Rs 2,000.

""This is a welcome step by RBI to increase transactions and e-mandate limit,"" said Dilip Asbe, CEO, NPCI.
""The increased limit will also help to boost the average value of transaction and push the adoption of digital payments.""

The move comes after several representations made by card networks such as Visa and Mastercard.

“As evident in recent months, there is strong consumer preference for digital payments and the new enhanced limits for e-mandates and contactless cards will help transition millions of Indian consumers from cash to fast, convenient and secure forms of digital payments,” said T R Ramachandran, group country manager, India & South Asia, Visa.

The move was also accompanied by easing of norms around e-mandate and everyday settlement of transactions through key National Payments Corporation of India operated channels such as UPI, AePS, RuPay and IMPS. 

“With this enablement, it is proposed to reduce settlement and default risk in the system by facilitating settlement of AePS, IMPS, NETC, NFS, RuPay, UPI transactions on all days of the week. This will make the payments ecosystem more efficient,” Das said in his speech.

He also said that a central bank team is probing outages faced by State Bank of India’s mobile application platform."

Investment RationaleHDFCB has steadfastly denied the need for a capital raise since the early days of covid-19 and guided for a lower impact of the crisis than most managements, at every stage. Macro trajectory aside, it also remains a comment on the bank’s risk selection and capital productivity consciousness. It continues to put a premium on resilience, which is what HDFCB offers—a strong balance sheet and likely higher residual capital than most. This higher residual capital ensures that its best-in-class franchise can support an adequately large balance sheet after this crisis and fulfil its earnings potential. In terms of gap between reported net worth and ‘true residual equity’, the bank is in the top quartile in our coverage universe. It continues to be among top two sectoral picks.

HDFC Bank,"Dec 03, 2020, 05:11 PM IST",ET in the classroom: How the RBI move on HDFC Bank affects customers,"The Reserve Bank of India’s move to temporarily ban private lender HDFC Bank from onboarding new credit card clients and launching digital initiatives has led to a confusion among the customer’s minds on what services will be affected. In this latest edition of ET in the classroom,
 Saloni Shukla finds out how does the RBI diktat affect you, the customer.


What has the RBI done?
The Reserve Bank of India has asked HDFC Bank to temporarily stop all digital launches and sourcing new credit card customers. The RBI order also states that the lender’s board needs to examine these lapses and fix accountability.


Why did the RBI do this?
This unprecedented move by the RBI came after the bank suffered its third big outage in the span of just two years. The bank faced its first big outage in November 2018 while upgrading its mobile application and internet banking. A year later it faced its second outage in December 2019, forcing RBI to send its team to study the issues that the lender was facing. Another incident happened on November 21 due to a power outage in its Primary Data Centre, after which customers weren’t able to access digital offerings for 2 days.


How does it affect you?
The RBI move does not affect existing clients. You will be able to access your mobile or internet banking solutions. You will also be able to use your existing credit card, open bank accounts, borrow loans and conduct a variety of other banking transactions.


What is allowed and not allowed?
If you are an existing credit card user and your card expires, the bank will issue you a new card. If your card gets lost you will be issued a replacement. But, since the bank will have to stop sourcing new credit card customers, no new clients will be able to avail these services till the RBI lifts the ban.


How does it disrupt HDFC Bank’s digital rollout?
Some of the bank’s strategic digital initiatives to improve the front end digital experience, improve digital origination, straight through processing, next generation of mobile and internet banking, APIs based banking on the edge etc would now be readied and launched post the approval and clearance from regulator."

“The broad market is continuing its buoyancy, led by rally in mid & small cap stocks. This trend can continue given the gap between the pricing of main and broad stocks. Today, large caps are mildly underperforming, in which financial stocks did contribute to the upside, but weakness in HDFC bank post the RBI curbs limited the upside. Hopes are alive that economic recovery will grow wider as fresh Covid cases are reducing, adding strength to the momentum,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

HDFC Bank,"Dec 03, 2020, 04:10 PM IST","After RBI action on outages, HDFC Bank CEO steps in to allay customer fears","HDFC Bank CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan on Thursday assured existing clients of the bank and said that they could continue to transact with the bank without any concern. Jagdishan also said that the bank with comply with the regulator’s diktat. 

RBI on Thursday asked HDFC Bank to temporarily halt new digital offerings and stop sourcing credit card customers. 

“Many of you may have read or heard about the RBI order asking us to temporarily stop any new digital banking launches and sourcing of new credit card customers. We will comply with the regulator's requirements,” Jagdishan said in a note to customers. “We take this opportunity to assure our existing customers that there is no reason to worry. You can continue to transact with the Bank without any concern.” 

Jagdishan also offered apology for the recent outages that the bank has faced. 

“We realize that as our valued customer, you expect us to maintain a very high standard of service quality and experience,” he wrote. “And sometimes, we have not been able to live up to your expectations. For that, please accept our sincere apologies.” 

The bank faced its first big outage in November 2018 while upgrading its mobile application and internet banking. A year later it faced its second outage in December 2019, forcing RBI to send its team to study the issues that the lender was facing. Since then the bank has taken steps to strengthen its IT infrastructure and systems. 

Unexpectedly another incident happened on November 21,2020 and the primary reason for the collapse was power outage in its Primary Data Centre. 
“We are working on war footing to strengthen this area also now,” Jagdishan told customers.


He also stated that some of the bank’s digital offerings will be launched once the regulator gets approval from RBI. 
“Some of our strategic digital initiatives to improve the front end digital experience, improve digital origination, straight through processing, next generation of mobile and internet banking, APIs based banking on the edge etc would now be readied and launched post the approval and clearance from regulator,” he said. 

Jagdishan assured customers that the bank will work with the experts and the regulator to fortify the identified areas for improvement."
HDFC Bank,"Dec 03, 2020, 02:48 PM IST",RBI ban on HDFC Bank could stay for 3-6 months: Macquarie Capital,"MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India move to temporarily halt all digital launches and sourcing new credit card customers for HDFC Bank could stay for three to six months according to a note by Macquarie Capital. The bank could apply to the RBI for a review of its decision only after fixing the technology and scale issues, the brokerage house noted.

“We believe the ban could be in place for around 3-6months as the bank would at least take a quarter to resolve some of these issues and then invite RBI for a review post which RBI may relax the restrictions in our view,” said Suresh Ganapathy, associate director, Macquarie Capital.

While this is the first big challenge for newly minted chief executive Sasidhar Jagdishan, Ganapathy argued that one should not give much weight to the fact that the outage issue happened after Puri’s exit.

“We won’t read this as an issue specific to the new CEO,” he said. “Technology outages were also happening under the earlier CEO Mr. Puri. As argued earlier, the biggest challenge for the bank under the new CEO Sashi Jagdishan is to build scale when they already have a 10% market share.”

This unprecedented order by the RBI comes after the bank suffered its third big outage in the span of just two years. The RBI order also states that the lender’s board needs to examine these lapses and fix accountability.

“The RBI has advised to stop all launches of the Digital Business generating activities planned under its program - Digital 2.0 (to be launched) and other proposed business generating IT applications and (sourcing of new credit card customers,” the bank said in an exchange filing. “The above measures shall be considered for lifting upon satisfactory compliance with the major critical observations as identified by the RBI.”

Though the bank added that it does not see a material impact of this on its profitability.

“We view this as a temporary setback and don’t see material impact to their profitability,” Ganapathy added. “We remain confident of their ability to reduce cost to income ratio by 100bps every year for the next five years to 35%.”

As of September 30, the bank had 15,292 ATMs in 2,848 cities. Its customers have 14.9 million credit cards and 33.8 million debit cards, according to RBI data, making it one of the largest transaction banks in the country.

The private sector lender was the third-largest remitter bank in October on the UPI network behind State Bank of India and Axis Bank with 179.5 million transactions and a technical failure rate of 0.81%, according to National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) data."

The central bank has also asked the bank’s board to examine the lapses and fix accountability.

At 2 pm, SBI Cards & Payment Services was up 4.78 per cent at Rs 835, while HDFC Bank dropped 1.74 per cent to Rs 1,382.45. In comparison, Sensex was up 0.08 per cent at 44,655.48 points.

While HDFC Bank is the largest credit card issuer in India, SBI Cards is the second-largest pure-play credit-card issuer in the country. The company’s separate identity from the parent SBI helps SBIC focus solely on the credit card business and offer customized products.

UPL,"Dec 14, 2020, 04:24 PM IST",Whistle-blower plaints at Nifty cos up 17% in FY20,"Mumbai: Erosion of about Rs 4,000 crore of market cap of the UPL stock in the wake of a whistle-blower complaint yet again underscored the significance of serious whistle-blowers in India Inc. An analysis by the ET Intelligence Group has revealed a 17 per cent increase in whistle-blower complaints received by Nifty-50 companies in 2019-20, with 19 member companies cumulatively disclosing a record number of 5,307 complaints.

Just three companies accounted for 70 per cent of these complaints, with IT firm Wipro topping the list, closely followed by the country’s largest lender, State Bank of India, and another leading IT company Tech Mahindra.

To be sure, most of these complaints tended to be of a non-serious nature. For instance, as per Wipro’s annual report, the top categories of complaints were workplace concerns and harassment (34 per cent), and people processes (32 per cent). Most of the cases (82 per cent) were resolved through engagement of human resources or mediation, or closed since they were unsubstantiated.


Experts said the increase in whistle-blower complaints in corporate India was an encouraging sign. “The longer and deeper the vigil mechanism takes roots, the wider is the variety of the complaints that involve employers or seniors at work, customers or suppliers, members of the public, as well as personal grievances.” said Milind Sarwate, independent director on several Indian boards.

Whistle-blower complaints are not actively tracked by institutional investors till a serious one emerges that flags issues related to corporate governance, insider trading or financial fraud. Most of the leading companies of the benchmark index shied away from disclosing the actual number of complaints received by them during the year, despite having a whistle-blower policy and complaint mechanism in place.

The number of companies that did not disclose the number of complaints rose to 31 in 2019-20 from 23 in the previous financial year. While a few companies merged whistle-blower complaints with overall stakeholder complaints, others did not cite them at all.

“A process with no complaints is not a good situation to be in.” Sarwate told ET. “It could indicate that the people covered by the mechanism are either unaware of it or are scared of the consequences or both.”

Public sector companies in Nifty cited the number of vigilance cases with no separate list of whistle-blower complaints. “Reporting of whistle-blower complaints needs to be much more granular,” said Shriram Subramanian of InGovern, a proxy advisory firm. “There is no uniform guideline on what needs to be reported and how.”For example, while IT bellwether Infosys said it had received 909 complaints related to disciplinary issues, it did not say how many among these were whistle-blower complaints.

In November 2019, a whistle-blower had accused the company’s CEO of indulging in “misdeeds”."
UPL,"Dec 11, 2020, 08:26 AM IST",UPL shares tank on whistle-blower claims,"Mumbai: Shares of agrochemical company UPL plunged up to 15 per cent on Thursday after ET Prime cited whistle-blower claims of alleged financial fraud by the promoters at the Nifty constituent. The whistle-blower, whom ET Prime identified as a board member, had alleged that UPL entered into rent deals with a shell company owned by its employees and paid crores of rupees as rent for properties owned by them.

The stock, which opened at Rs 479.90, hit a low of Rs 416 before closing 11 per cent lower at Rs 438.45. It was the biggest loser among the Nifty members, and was also the most active stock on the NSE.

However, UPL management clarified that there were no related party transactions, as alleged. “UPL believes that there is a sustained campaign to malign the image of the company and the group, and it is important that the correct picture is presented to all its stakeholders as the news report seems to create an unseemly controversy about corporate governance at UPL,” UPL said in an exchange filing.

It also said that an identical whistle-blower complaint was received by the audit committee on June 2, 2017. The committee investigated the charges and all the contents of the complaint were fully disclosed, it stated.

An email query sent to the company did not elicit any response till the time of going to press.

UPL is not new to controversies. Sandra Shroff, vice chairman of the agrochemicals company, had resigned from the board just before the annual general meeting on August 31 as proxy advisory firms recommended that institutional investors should vote against her reappointment as non-executive director, citing the excessive remuneration paid to her through subsidiaries or group companies.

The Mumbai-based firm paid more than Rs 100 crore as remuneration to three non-executive directors — Sandra Shroff, Jai Shroff and Vikram Shroff — in FY20 through its subsidiaries to allegedly bypass the disclosure norms and approval requirements, the Stakeholders Empowerment Services (SES) said."

The company was responding to a report by ETPrime, which cited a whistleblower complaint about alleged siphoning off money by the promoter.

The whistleblower, whom ET Prime identified as a board member of the listed agrochemicals company, had alleged that UPL entered into rent deals with a shell company owned by its employees and paid crores of rupees in rent for properties owned by them, and before them by Jaidev Shroff, the UPL chief himself.

Shorff said he believed there was a systematic malicious campaign to spoil the reputation of his family and UPL.

Asked if any large shareholders have exited the company, Shroff said: ""I have not checked of late. UPL is a widely traded company. I believe there is a decent amount of buying. ""

ETPrime said it tried to independently verify the various accusations made by the whistleblower from the documents provided and the information available from lings at the Ministry of Corporate Affair (MCA) and stock exchanges. ETPrime also reached out to UPL, its directors, the then auditor SRBC & Co, an affiliate of global auditing firm EY, to have their perspectives on these allegations and get a clearer view of what might have happened.

""This is quite malicious. We had given the reporter complete access to information. He never visited us and searched for any other information. We asked them to come in and get the audit notes and also review all the documents. He still went on to issue the note,"" Shroff claimed.

The ETPrime report said there were certain corporate governance issues with regards to the transactions done by the UPL promoters. The issues were also raised in the past at the company’s board and to its former auditor SRBC & Co."

Continuing the northbound journey, the Nifty opened above 13,100, marking a record high at 13,146. However, it failed to cling on to the higher levels. Eventually, the Nifty lost 1.5 per cent breaking below levels of 12,900-mark. Wednesday’s decline took the form of a large bearish candle, closing below the previous minor hurdle of 12,950. Follow-up action needs to be closely watched as sustenance below 12,950 could mean Nifty is back to the previous 12,950-12,750 trading band.

Bank Nifty made a high near 30,200. However, it lost over 1,000 points from the day high. Bank Nifty could continue its recent consolidation above 28,500.

All the sectoral indices ended in red, except PSU Bank index, which outperformed in today’s trade (i.e. up ~2 per cent).

India Vix index rose 10 per cent, reclaiming levels of 23. On Nifty’s options front, for the November series, massive additions are visible at 12,900 and 13,000 call and unwinding across the put strikes. It represents a sudden change in sentiment with an immediate hurdle near 13000.

After a series of positive closes, Nifty retreated from the higher levels on Thursday. It opened on a negative note below 12,850. However, it recouped early losses to make a high at 12,963. Eventually, the Nifty ended below the 12,800-mark closing near the day's low. Inability to surpass or sustain above 12,950 has slowed down the momentum on the upside. While levels of 12,800 need to be closely watched, sustenance below 12,800 could attract mild correction till 12,700-12,650 zone.

On the options front, significant open interest additions are visible at 12,900 and 13,000 call strikes for the November series while 12,800 holds second highest OI base, which again highlights that sustenance below 12,800 could mean that Nifty is due for mean reversion.

Bank Nifty snapped four sessions’ winning streak, despite Wednesday’s bullish candle with close near day’s high. In today’s trade, Bank Nifty traded in the negative territory throughout the session.

Titan Company,"Dec 03, 2020, 10:31 AM IST",Festive sparkle drives Rakesh Jhunjhunwala’s favourite bet to record high; will the fireworks continue?,"MUMBAI: Rakesh Jhunjhunwala’s prized possession Titan Company has hit a record high, buoyed by robust festive sales, and as investors showed a preference for the industry leader in a market where valuations have turned expensive.

Analysts are still upbeat on the prospects of the stock and see more steam in the rally for this watch and jewelry maker from the Tata Group.

Jhunjhunwala first bought Titan in 2002-03 at an average price of Rs 3, according to media reports, and the stock now has significant weightage in his portfolio. He held 4.43 per cent stake in the company at the end of September quarter, while his wife Rekha Jhunjhunwala owned 1.09 per cent. At current market price, the couple’s total holding in Titan is valued at Rs 6,803 crore.

Currently, the stock has 2 ‘strong buy’, 10 ‘buy’, 10 ‘hold’, 5 ‘sell’ and 2 ‘strong sell’ ratings, data from Reuters Eikon showed.

The stock is up 19 per cent in last one month and hit an all-time high of 1,391.45 on Wednesday. It has been a consistent performer and returned 633 per cent for last 10 years, 268 per cent for last five, 72 per cent for three.

Gautam Duggad, Head Of Research for Institutional Equities at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said Titan remains India’s best discretionary consumption play given the underlying big opportunity in branded jewellery, weakened regional competition, shift from unorganized to organized, rising compliance requirements and favourable demographics.

“It is consistently gaining market share and also witnessing structural premiumisation trends in favour of studded jewellery,” Duggad said

Deven Choksey, Group Managing Director, KR Choksey Investment Managers, says the situation is turning normal for most of the companies such as Titan post-Covid. “The jewellery business has also picking up, in the festive season,” he said

“Majority of the new funds entering the market want to buy the leaders, and are willing to pay a premium for them. Titan is one such name. The valuations are expensive, but the leadership justifies the premium,” he added.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have hiked stake in Titan by 50 basis points in the September quarter to 18.05 per cent, while mutual funds have been trimming their stake in the company since the last two quarters, and held 4.63 per cent at the end of September.

Last month, the Tata group firm said it saw good traction across all its businesses in the festive season and its jewellery business witnessed a ""mid-teens"" growth from Dussehra till Diwali.

""The jewellery business witnessed a mid-teens growth (around 15 per cent) for the 30 day festive season starting from Dussehra till Diwali over the corresponding period last year, with a decent recovery in studded jewellery sales,"" the company said in a business update.

Titan said its watches and wearables business also did good business during the festive season with recovery close to last year levels.

On November 25, Emkay analysts reiterated their buy rating and raised the target price to Rs 1,450 from Rs 1,300 earlier.

“Strong wedding season, pent-up demand and stable gold prices boosting demand can drive upsides to jewelry forecasts, in our view,” Emkay analysts said in a note.

“With improving growth visibility and higher earnings outlook than peers, we expect Titan to trade at multiples in line with other high growth peers,” the brokerage added.

Not everyone was so optimistic though.

“There has been a festive and wedding season demand, which led to a spike in sales. We need to see if the normal sales over the next few months return to pre-Covid levels,” said independent analyst Ambareesh Baliga.

Baliga also pointed that with gold prices peaking out, the robust inventory gains that had accrued earlier may not sustain going ahead.

“I was recommending the stock at lower levels, but at the current levels, it seems fully priced,” Baliga said."
Titan Company,"Dec 01, 2020, 09:03 PM IST",Fears of pandemic’s second wave worries Tanishq this wedding season even as it registers increased wallet share,"Uncertainty looming around the second wave of the pandemic poses as a challenge for the wedding season this quarter despite increase in wallet share for bridal jewellery as consumers refrain from big fat weddings amid Covid-19 outbreak, said Tata Group-owned Tanishq’s chief executive Ajoy Chawla at a press conference to launch a purchase plan for wedding jewellery to drive consumption. 

“Unless a vaccine for Covid-19 is found, uncertainty around the pandemic will tend to defer jewellery purchase. There is a threat of the second wave of Covid-19 outbreak which remains a challenge this wedding season as we will have to ensure zero-error transactions across 450 retail outlets. Another associated challenge is fluctuating gold price that defers purchase,” said Chawla, CEO of jewellery division at Titan Company, that sells brands Tanishq, Zoya, Mia and Caratlane. 

Wedding jewellery shopping in India is often a well-planned affair. Titan’s jewellery division has been banking on pent-up demand and deferred weddings from the pandemic quarter this festive season to bring the quantum of the business for the fiscal disrupted by Covid-19 outbreak.

“People are not spending on events such as destination weddings and elaborate wedding apparel. The number of wedding functions has reduced significantly due to the pandemic. The spend has shifted to bridal jewellery in these times,” said Chawla, adding, “The average ticket value of wedding jewellery has increased by 40% which could also be driven by increase in gold prices.”

However, the jewellery maker said it registered 15% sales growth in the division between Dusshera to Dhanteras this festive quarter with about 24% of the business coming from wedding jewellery segment so far. 

“The festive season has shown sustained growth. We have stopped talking recovery and started talking about growth now,” said Chawla. 

While the company had anticipated the need for lighter jewellery amid pressure on earnings this pandemic-disrupted fiscal, weddings in urban metros still opted for heavy-weight jewellery. “Rural weddings scheduled in the fourth quarter, however, may want pieces as light in weight as possible,” said Chawla. 

According to regulatory filing, the jewellery division of Titan Company had outperformed other divisions and recorded an income of Rs 3837 crore, an increase of 8.75% in the second quarter ended September, driven by improved customer sentiment with greater willingness to spend on plain gold jewellery and gold coins rather than pure discretionary items."

Two major events -- short covering ahead of November 2020 F&O expiry and rebalancing of MSCI portfolios -- helped the Indian market to recover sharply from lower levels. The Nifty50 index regained 13,000 levels and is now exhibiting remarkable strength. The unusual support from commodities and financials always helps the market move forward. Technically, for the next two days, 13,070 and 13,150 levels would be major hurdles for the index. If the Nifty50 index crosses 13,150, it could jump to 13,350 levels. However, below 12,930, the index would invite worries in the near term.

“As part of the overall reorganisation proposal, the company proposes to utilise the consideration to be received from Reliance entities from slump sale of the business undertakings, to prepay the various NCDs the company has issued and one of the NCDs proposed to be prepaid is NCD-XV, viz the debentures held by debenture holders of this meeting,” FEL said in a notice for convening of the meeting.

FEL has raised funds by issuing various debt instruments including NCDs by way of private placement, from time to time for its expansion.

However, the Future group firm has reported several defaults on interest payment of NCDs after the pandemic.

According to FEL, coronavirus had a significant impact on businesses and particularly, lockdown, closure of stores and the slowdown in economic activity resulted in significant decrease in its revenues and profitability.

“To put it simply, our liquidity position has been affected for reasons beyond our control and despite our sincere efforts, we are currently facing extreme difficulty in generating the cash required to service our external debt obligations,” it said.

As per the terms of the offer for its NCD-XV, FEL was expected to pay to the debenture-holders, the amount of interest and principal on respective due dates. However, COVID-19 severely impacted cash flows and it utilised Rs 5.13 crore from Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) created for NCD-XV for paying interest, FEL said.

It has also requested the holders to consider relaxation in the clauses of Debenture Trust Deeds, which mandates that if the company utilises DSRA, it should replenish the same within a period of seven days.

“However, the reason of the company utilising the DSRA is due to it not having ready cashflows available and it would be difficult for the company to ensure the same at least for another six months, till the time the transaction is consummated,"" the company said.

Accordingly, FEL has also proposed to modify the clause and remove the replenishment condition to ensure that there is neither any default or cross-default which gets triggered due to non-replenishment of DSRA.

On August 29, 2020, Future had announced the sale of its retail and wholesale business and logistics and warehousing business by merging 5 listed entities of the Group and 14 subsidiary and step-down subsidiaries companies into FEL.

As per the deal, Reliance Retail Ventures would acquire the popular Future brand stores such as Big Bazaar, fbb, Foodhall, Easyday, Nilgiris, Central and Brand Factory."

The combined wealth of these 7 billionaires was near the $200 billion mark (at $194.39 billion) on Friday, December 11, after rising a strong 50 per cent so far this year, data compiled from the Bloomberg Billionaire Index showed. 

$1 billion equalled Rs 7,364 crore as of Friday.

First-generation entrepreneur Gautam Adani, who owns assets across renewable energy, ports, terminals and logistics, among other sectors, has seen his wealth swell by some $21.1 billion so far in 2020. He is now worth $32.4 billion compared with $11.3 billion at the end of last year.

Mukesh Ambani, the richest Indian, has added $18.1 billion to his fortunes, which stood at $76.7 billion at last count. He was worth $58.6 billion at the end of last year.

Ambani runs India’s most-valued company Reliance Industries, which has interests in oil & gas, telecom and retail sectors.

Cyrus Poonawalla, the vaccine king of India, whose Serum Institute of India is leading the Covid fight, has seen his fortunes soar by $6.91 billion to $15.6 billion. Pune-based Serum, an unlisted entity, is the world’s largest vaccine producer.

Shiv Nadar of HCL Technologies and Azim Premji of Wipro together added nearly $12 billion to their fortunes.

Nadar’s HCL Tech is India’s third largest IT exporter. His fortunes stood at $22 billion, up $6.29 billion year-to-date. Wipro’s Premji saw his wealth grow by $5.26 billion to $23.6 billion.

The Covid-19 disruption increased demand for IT solutions from enterprises. 

Celebrated investor and the owner of D-Mart chain of hypermarkets, Radhakishan Damani, has seen his wealth grow by $4.71 billion to $14.4 billion. Dilip Shanghvi of Sun Pharma is now worth $9.69 billion, up $2.23 billion.


Stock rallyMost of the addition to Gautam Adani’s wealth was led by a 525 per cent rise in shares of Adani Green Energy. Adani Green’s market-cap has surged to Rs 1.63 lakh crore as of Friday from Rs 26,040 crore as of December 31, 2019.

Shares of Adani Gas have risen 120 per cent, those of Adani Enterprises 116 per cent, Adani Transmission 28 per cent and Adani Ports & SEZ advanced 27 per cent. The Adani Power stock fell 27.91 per cent.

Six of Mukesh Ambani’s companies are listed in India, but the bulk of his fortunes come from Reliance Industries. The most valued company on BSE had a market value of Rs 13.56 lakh crore on Friday, up 33 per cent from Rs 9.59 lakh crore as of December 31, 2019.

Five other Ambani stocks – Hathway Bhawani Cabletel & Datacom (up 468 per cent), Hathway Cable & Datacom (72.38 per cent), Network 18 Media & Investment (49 per cent), Den Networks (42 per cent) and Reliance Industrial Infrastructure (37 per cent) -- have also logged handsome gains this year.

Shiv Nadar’s HCL Tech is up 52 per cent year to date while Premji’s Wipro has gained 43.82 per cent, Damani’s DMart has rallied 40.77 per cent Shanghvi’s Sun Pharma 31 per cent.

RIL,"Dec 10, 2020, 07:20 AM IST",Sensex on Mount 46k: So what's really driving this surge?,"Mumbai: The Sensex crossed 46,000 and the Nifty topped 13,500 for the first time on Wednesday as the wave of foreign money continued to sweep across emerging markets, driven by hopes of an early vaccine and signs of stronger economic growth. 

The 30-share Sensex rose 495 points, or 1.1%, to close at a record 46,103.50 after touching a lifetime high of 46,164.10 during the day. The Nifty too set a record, climbing 136.15 points, or 1%, to close at 13,529.10. It touched an all-time high of 13,548.90 earlier in the day.

Optimism over the progress of the additional $908 billion fiscal stimulus in the US also drove sentiment in global markets, pushing European markets higher on Wednesday. In the US, the S&P 500 and the Dow eased from record levels as investors kept an eye out for developments related to the stimulus deal. Though the package is lower than what was envisaged earlier, investors are hoping for its early passage to prevent further weakening of the world’s largest economy.

“I don’t think the stimulus is big but it helps at the margin to get things started in the US economy,” said Andrew Holland, CEO, Avendus Cap Alternate Strategies.



Sensex, Nifty up 4% in Dec

“But the risk in the market is to the downside because everything is there in terms of all the good news and the bad news is being ignored. We just have to live with the liquidity and the fact that market will move up on any positive news,” he said.

Foreign portfolio investors pumped ₹3,564 crore into shares here on Wednesday, taking their total purchase tally for December so far to almost ₹16,900 crore. In November, they lapped up shares worth ₹74,500 crore — the highest in a month. The Sensex and Nifty, which had gained 11% in November, are up 4% in December so far.

Indian stocks are the most expensive compared with other emerging market equities after the 80% run-up in the benchmark indices since March 24. The Nifty is trading at a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 21.8 times estimated earnings, which is at a 42% premium to its 15-year average. But few are willing to go against the tide favouring India.

Viktor Shvets, Asian equity strategist at brokerage Macquarie, has cut his weight on India but did not downgrade it to sell, citing lack of opportunities, large domestic demand-driven economy and stronger ability to offer stimuli to the economy.

What has encouraged optimists to believe that the rally could last a little longer is that a new set of stocks is leading the recent runup. While technology bigwigs, Reliance Industries and select lenders such as HDFC Bank, HDFC among others led the first leg of the market gains since March, the march since November has been led by other banks and select consumer stocks that did not participate in the advance till then.

“The sequential re-rating of different sectors over the past nine months is linked to growing conviction about economic and earnings recovery and the negative impact of Covid-19 pandemic being far less severe than the market’s initial expectations in March,” said Kotak Institutional Equities. “The top-down valuations of the Indian market (Nifty50 Index) look quite full but we would not rule out earnings upgrades over the next few months led by normalisation of economic activities across more sectors,” it said.

Technical analysts believe a pause in the rally cannot be ruled out."

RIL,"Dec 08, 2020, 04:17 PM IST",D-Street rally could broaden to include banks as Reliance peaks,"India’s record-breaking equity rally will continue next year, with banks and other stocks taking over as drivers from the nation’s largest company Reliance Industries Ltd., some fund managers say.

Reliance has accounted for nearly a fifth of the 75% surge in the S&P BSE Sensex from its March bottom, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s about double the contribution Apple Inc. has made to gains in the S&P 500 Index over the same period. Some market watchers say Reliance’s gains may have peaked for now, prompting the search for new leaders.

The prospects for global recovery amid progress with Covid-19 vaccines has caused investors to shift focus from defensive growth stocks to cheaper economically sensitive shares. That may be particularly good news for financial stocks that have lagged in the rally that has driven the Sensex to an all-time high and propelled India’s total market value to over $2.3 trillion.

“Banking and financial stocks could have the most scope to take the market leadership,” said Mahesh Patil, co-chief investment officer at Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Ltd. in Mumbai, which had assets under management of around $31 billion as of end-September. He also said metals stocks should perform well because China’s economy is growing again.

BloombergReliance’s performance has been driven by billions of dollars of investment in its businesses by the likes of Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which should help speed the Indian conglomerate’s transition from energy to digital services. Its shares surged to a record in September, pushing their earnings-based valuation to about double the five-year average, though Reliance has slipped 14% since then.

“It’s hard to get excited by energy prospects at this time, or price digital services significantly ahead of where the implied value already is,” said Piyush Sharma, who manages the Minerva India Underserved portfolio for Right Horizons. “Our sense is market leadership could shift away from the likes of Reliance over the next year.”

That thought is echoed by Sachin Shah, a fund manager at Emkay Investment Managers Ltd. in Mumbai, who expects to see “a much more broad-based rally over the next few quarters.” Shah notes that the pandemic has been a catalyst for companies in various industries to cut costs, which should make their stocks more attractive.

Banks in particular could benefit from the hunt for new investment ideas. Still grappling with the fallout of a crisis in the shadow-banking sector when the pandemic hit, financials were among the biggest losers in the selloff earlier this year, and they have underperformed in the rebound that followed. That may change as the market turns its attention to cheaper shares.

Right Horizons’ Sharma sees value and earnings as the chief factors for India investors in 2021, with the best opportunities in both lying outside of the larger stock gauges.

The S&P BSE SmallCap Index has climbed 29% this year, while the S&P BSE MidCap Index has gained 18%, both outpacing the 11% advance for the Sensex, after two years of underperformance. The smaller measures may have greater scope for gains, with both still trading below their early 2018 highs."

 ""In order to maintain this lead, policy steps are needed to accelerate early rollout of 5G, and to make it affordable and available everywhere.

new guidelines for the discovery of market price, an official order said.

The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas last week notified guidelines for the discovery of market prices for domestically produced natural gas through 
e-
bidding.

The government has since 2017 given pricing freedom for natural gas produced from all fields other than the old fields of state-owned ONGC and Oil India Ltd in nomination blocks.

Firms such as Reliance Industries-BP combine as well as ONGC (for non-nomination blocks) have been auctioning gas to users. They would typically devise a formula and seek bids from users.

They will continue to devise a pricing formula, but will now have to seek bids on the electronic-platform of five pre-selected agencies, the notification said.

The agencies are SBI Capital Markets Ltd, mjunction Services Ltd, RITES, MSTC and CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solution Ltd.

This follows the Union Cabinet in October allowing marketing freedom for blocks where pricing freedom already existed. Alongside, it approved standardised bidding for price discovery.

The companies ""shall design the tender/ bid offer, including the eligibility criteria, bid parameters, evaluation criteria, tender fee, salient terms and conditions of Gas Sales Agreement and any other relevant information etc, with a view to encourage wider participation from prospective buyers, promote competition and maximise the value of natural gas offered,"" it said.

ONGC and OIL are also to follow these guidelines for the discovery of the market price of natural gas produced from their fields wherever pricing and marketing freedom has been granted, the order said.

""The existing gas sales agreements, made in connection with contract provisions, would continue till the duration of the agreements/contracts and thereafter subsequent sale of gas shall be subject to these guidelines,"" it added.

Reliance and its partner BP have sold initial 5 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from their second wave of discoveries in the KG-D6 block for five years.

ONGC too has sold initial gas from the neighbouring KG-D5 block.

The two will use the 
new guidelines whenever the existing contracts expire or they have additional quantities of gas to offer.

The order said the companies must ensure at least 21 days' time for bidding.

They have to submit to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) details of the auction such as a list of participants, qualified bidders and selected bidders with their price and quantity allocated.

""The entire proceeding will be conducted by the contractor/producer without any need for the approval of the government,"" the order said. ""The government, however, will have the right to ask for information and intervene if there are reasons to believe that there is foul play.""

The companies have to invite bids from prospective buyers of natural gas through an 
e-
bidding portal, it said.

""National oil companies, viz ONZC and OIL shall also follow the guidelines for the discovery of market price of natural gas produced from their nomination fields wherever pricing and marketing freedom has been granted,"" it said.

While the price of gas produced from nomination fields is dictated by the government, ONGC and OIL have the freedom to sell gas from difficult fields such as deepsea."

RIL,"Dec 05, 2020, 08:18 AM IST","We will work to serve customers better than anybody else: Doug McMillon, CEO Walmart","Mumbai: Walmart remains unperturbed by the competition from Amazon and Reliance Industries, and is as aggressive as the rivals in the Indian ecommerce market that has plenty of room for growth, the chief executive at the parent of Flipkart said.

“Did we know that Reliance and Amazon and many others will be super aggressive? Absolutely. But we are too,” Doug McMillon said at the Morgan Stanley Virtual Global Consumer & Retail Conference on Thursday. “You can debate, do you think Walmart will be number one in the market given what Amazon and Reliance are doing, or whether we will be number two in the market. We will work to serve customers better than anybody else and hopefully be the biggest.”

Reliance Industries’ aggressive push into online retailing has roiled the Indian ecommerce market. Goldman Sachs recently predicted RIL to capture 30% of the market in the next five years, eating into the share of Flipkart and Amazon. At the Morgan Stanley conference, McMillon said the rivals were doing exactly what Walmart had expected, and that he remained hopeful of Flipkart, which the US retailer acquired in 2018, retaining its leadership position.




Walmart said Flipkart and its payment platform PhonePe have caught the Indian digital wave.

“Those are really good businesses and they have done just what we thought they would do since we made the investment. And there’s nothing that's changed that causes us to be concerned or to have changed our view on the investment,"" McMillon said.


Huge Potential in India
On Thursday, Flipkart said it was partially spinning off PhonePe to raise $700 million. In July, Flipkart had announced acquiring parent Walmart’s loss-ridden cash-and-carry business in India, Best Price, marking a consolidation of the American major’s entire retail portfolio in the country.

Comparing the Indian market with Argentina, Walmart said the opportunity in India was enormous. The world's biggest retailer announced selling its retail operations in the Latin American country last month. 

India has a huge population that over time will grow income level and ecommerce is still a tiny percent of overall retail, Walmart said.

At present, the online retail market in India is largely controlled by Amazon and Flipkart. But experts feel dedicated platforms such as Nykaa in beauty, 1mg in pharma and BigBasket in grocery are likely to thrive in their categories, even as Reliance is expected to become a key player in the overall market, and especially in grocery."

According to the order, the resolution applicant — in this case, Reliance Digital — has proposed to pay Rs 3,720 crore for the corporate debtor (Reliance Infratel). The money will be distributed among the lenders to the tower arm of Reliance Communications, the bankrupt and now-defunct telecom company of the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group.

Besides this, the lenders are likely to get another Rs800 crore from the sale of a land parcel held by Reliance Realty, which is also part of the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group. But if Reliance Realty could not get Rs 800 crore for the land, the resolution applicant will purchase it for Rs 800 crore and distribute the amount to the lenders on a pro-rata basis, according to the ruling.

The resolution plan also includes a fund infusion of up to Rs 450 crore, which can be used as working capital to take care of urgent improvements and repairs at the tower company. Besides these, the resolution applicant or its affiliate or nominee would subscribe to Rs 5 crore worth equity shares of Reliance Infratel.

""The amount sought to be infused by the resolution applicant (RA) shall be kept in an interest-bearing deposit in any nationalised bank till disposal of the said applications,"" the order said.

Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Digital had outbid asset reconstruction company UVARCL, Bharti Airtel and VFSI Holdings for Reliance Infratel.

The order said Infratel would be maintained as "" a going concern"".

The corporate debtor will also benefit from the scale and the efficiency that the RA already enjoys, as one of the leading companies in India,"" said the NCLT order.

The next step will be regulatory approvals which will include one from the Reserve Bank of India, since payments to global lenders such as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) are involved, according to people in the know.

The lenders to Reliance Infratel though will have to take a significant haircut on their outstanding loans.

RIL,"Dec 02, 2020, 11:51 AM IST",Ayushmann Khurrana signs 7 ad deals since March amid Covid disruption,"MUMBAI: Actor Ayushmann Khurrana has signed seven new brand endorsement deals since March this year, as marketers seek celebrities who offer value at a time when cash flows are under pressure due to the disruption caused by Covid-19.

Khurrana, who has given eight back-to-back hits on the silver screen, including ‘Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan’ in February this year, is now the face of 19 brands.

Among the new endorsement deals Khurrana has signed are those for Toyota’s Urban Cruiser, Colgate, KitKat and Cipla.

The actor, who’s last film ‘Gulabo Sitabo’ couldn’t be released in theatres due to the lockdown, also featured in short advertisement campaigns of Hotstar, Reliance Fresh, Dhani Super Saver campaign and Castrol Activ.

Khurrana, who is currently shooting for Abhishek Kapoor's film ‘Chandigarh Kare Aashiqui’ at his hometown, told ET that when he chooses his films, he dives deep into the script to understand its appeal and ethos and he does the same while choosing brands to endorse.

“I try and understand if the concept will be clutter-breaking, if it’s fresh and not done to death, and if it will deliver superlative entertainment and value. The brand story has to somehow stand apart,” he said.

The young actor scores very high on emulatability, as per Indian Institute of Human Brands (IIHB).

Emulatability is an amalgam of people liking or loving the celebrity and wanting to be like the person.

Also, unlike many celebrities, Khurrana is not distant and forbidding, and thus his relatability is very high, contributing to his being seen as “endearing”, according to brand managers.

A recent study by IIHB had found Khurrana to be the most identifiable celebrity.

Sandeep Goyal, chief mentor of the IIHB, had commented that Khurrana getting plenty of endorsements is a sign that during troubled times, empathy works more than being handsome or stylish.

Last year, the actor had entered the top 10 of the Duff & Phelps’ celebrity brand valuation report for the first time, with a brand value of $40.3 million."

Bajaj Finserv,"Nov 09, 2020, 10:56 AM IST","As holdco discount widens to 55%, this stock looks poised for rebound","NEW DELHI: Down 39 per cent this year, shares of the otherwise consistent performer Bajaj Finserv have been signalling a 50-55 per cent holding company discount compared with 25-30 per cent historically, making analysts comfortable over the valuation of this Bajaj group company.

The scrip, which has no ‘sell’ call as of today, has been a consistent performer, rallying 23-132 per cent annually in nine out of last 11 years. The stock’s performance has been poor this year by its own standard: it had earlier dropped 17 per cent in 2013 and 7 per cent in 2011.

While concerns persist over the slow recovery of Bajaj Finance, analysts find comfort in the good show of the company's insurance JVs. The stock had seven 'buy', two 'outperform' and one 'hold' ratings in the publicly available with Reuters' Eikon database last week.


Company background
Bajaj Finserv is the holding company for Bajaj Group businesses dealing with financial services. It has 52.74 per cent stake in Bajaj Finance that itself has two fully-owned subsidiaries -- mortgage lender Bajaj Housing Finance and broking and depository firm Bajaj Financial Services.

Bajaj Finserv also holds 74 per cent stake each in insurance joint ventures Bajaj Allianz General Insurance (BAGIC) and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance (BALIC).


Q2 earnings
The Bajaj group firm reported an 18 per cent drop in consolidated profit for September quarter at Rs 986.30 crore against Rs 1,203.7 crore reported for the same quarter last year. The numbers were hit partly by Bajaj Finance's Rs 541 crore expected credit loss provision. Revenue for the quarter rose 6 per cent to Rs 15,051.60 crore from Rs 14,224.20 crore YoY. Asset under management rose 1 per cent to Rs 1,37,090 crore from Rs 1,35,533 crore YoY.

Among different businesses, the general insurance JV reported Rs 332 crore profit for September quarter, life insurance JV Rs 98 crore and NBFC Bajaj Finance Rs 965 crore.


Management commentary
Bajaj Finserv says the pandemic-linked lockdown imposed by the government impacted the group’s business operations considerably. It resulted in significantly lower business acquisition and hurt recovery of dues from customers, it added.

New loans booked by Bajaj Finance fell to Rs 36.2 lakh from Rs 64.7 lakh, which was more than double of the June quarter number. The general insurance arm’s gross written premium was marginally lower due to a drop in sales of commercial vehicles insurance, travel insurance and tenders for the government health business, but underwriting results were quite strong, Bajaj Finserv said.

The life insurance business JV was able to record 19 per cent growth in individual rated new business premium and delivered growth in new business value (NBV), the company said.


What do analysts say…
Edelweiss Securities said Bajaj Finserv reported soft results largely due to lower profitability in lending by Bajaj Finance and the life insurance arm. The insurer held up well due to improvement in underwriting performance, it said.

NBFC Bajaj Finance cut its FY21 AUM growth guidance to 6-7 per cent from 10-12 per cent earlier, even as it kept credit cost guidance unchanged at 4-4.1 per cent. Disbursements stood at 62 per cent of last year’s volume. The moratorium percentage fell to 8 per cent from 15.7 per cent.

Nomura India said Bajaj Finance’s business momentum clearly lagged frontline banks, with slow growth recovery seen even in September – urban B2B business grew to 72 per cent, auto finance to 54 per cent and B2C, SME and mortgages to 54 per cent of last year’s levels.

In the case of the insurance arm, while underwriting performance was strong, the lower investment income pulled down profit growth to 13 per cent.

The insurance arm’s partnerships with Axis Bank, Bandhan Bank, RBL Bank and India Post Payments Bank worked and led to outperformance in individual new business premiums. The demand for protection and high margin non-par guaranteed saving products remained strong and led to a favourable shift in the business mix, analysts said.

“The insurance subsidiaries are delivering well, with BAGIC delivering higher underwriting profits (adjusted for seasonality) and growth drags reducing. BALIC also delivered well on growth, with 19 per cent YoY individual APE growth and 290 basis points YoY rise in net VNB margin improvement in the first six months of the year,"" Nomura said.

APE stands for annual premium equivalent, and VNB for value of new business.


Valuations
JM Financial sees the stock at Rs 8,670, which suggests about 50 per cent upside over current market price. It expects Bajaj Finance to enter FY22 on a very strong footing, owing to highest capital level within the sector, a strong balance sheet, structurally higher profitability driven by permanent cost savings, and continued improvement in the liability profile.

“Bajaj FinServ’s insurance businesses are strong franchises and are likely to continue focus on selective underwriting and high-margin businesses,” it said.

Kotak said the encouraging performance of insurance subsidiaries creates upside potential to its targets. Bajaj Finance still accounts for 67 per cent of Bajaj Finserv's sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuations.

“Bajaj Finserv remains our preferred vehicle to play Bajaj Finance. The insurance players are adding a layer of icing,” it said, as it increased its price target to Rs 8,000 from Rs 7,600. This price target suggests 40 per cent upside from Monday's closing level.

The brokerage valued the BAGIC business at four times book value, which is lower than 4.7 times book value for ICICI Lombard. It sees BALIC at 1.4 times embedded value (EV), which is 2-3.8 times the EV of matured listed peers. For Bajaj Finance, Kotak assigns 3.8 times FY22 book .

“The recent underperformance has turned the valuations attractive. Hence, we maintain our ‘Hold’ call. Moreover, we do not alter our target multiple for respective businesses and price targets remain unchanged at Rs 7,200. The evolving dynamics of Bajaj Finance’s asset quality and growth resumption will primarily determine the stock’s performance,” Edelweiss said.

Rich valuations for Bajaj Finance at four times September 2022 book value restricts upside for Bajaj Finance, Nomura India said.

“However, we see value coming from the insurance business, and a holding company discount over 50 per cent for the lending business does provide much better risk-reward. This brokerage has a price target of Rs 7,550 on the stock,” the brokerage said."

The pandemic and consequent lockdown imposed by the governmental authorities has considerably impacted the group’s business operations for the half year ended September 30, in respect to subsidiaries engaged in the business of lending -- Bajaj Finance, together with its subsidiary, Bajaj Housing Finance, the company said in a release.

Apart from other adverse effects, the pandemic has also resulted in a significantly lower business acquisition and put constraints on recovery of overdues from customers of these subsidiaries, it added.

The group said it offered moratorium to its customers based on requests as well as on a suo moto basis from March 1 to August 31 in accordance with the guidelines from the Reserve Bank of India.

During the quarter, the company made an expected credit loss (ECL) provision on standard (stage 1 and 2) assets of Rs 1,370 crore, in respect of these subsidiaries, taking the overall EGL provision on standard assets to Rs 5,099 crore as on September 30.

The group said, it continues to hold a management overlay of Rs 2,260 crore as part of its ECL provision for standard assets of Rs 5,099 crore as on September 30.

Further, the company based on its estimate and judgement, has reversed capitalised interest of Rs 142 crore during the quarter, taking the overall reversal for the half year ended to Rs 361 crore. Given the dynamic and evolving nature of the pandemic, these estimates are subject to uncertainty and may be affected by the severity, duration of the pandemic and other variables, it added. 

The company participates in the financing business through its 52.74 per cent holding in Bajaj Finance and in the protection business through its 74 per cent holding in two unlisted subsidiaries, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company Limited (BAGIC) and Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company Limited (BALIC).

SiemensMarket cap: Rs 54,700 crore
CMP: Rs 1,536
Bought by: Kotak MF
Capital goods major Siemens is one of the key players which will benefit from the economic recovery. Better-than-expected financial performance in the fourth quarter, encouraging commentary on margins and strong order book are a few factors that make analysts feel the company will be a beneficiary of an economic recovery. It had order inflows of Rs 3,220 crore in the fourth quarter. It has an order book of Rs 12,400 crore which gives visibility of revenues of close to one and a half years. Besides, the company has been able to show pronounced growth in its EBIT margins across its business verticals which include gas and power, infrastructure, mobility and digital industries. Given these factors, analysts have upgraded the company’s EPS for the next two years in the range of 14-16.6 per cent.



J K CementMarket cap: Rs 15,066 crore
CMP: Rs 1,950
Bought by: DSP MF
Among mid-sized cement companies, J K Cement is placed well to cater to the strong demand from the northern region given its strong presence. It has completed the expansion of 4.2MT which will make its presence stronger in the north and help cater to central and western markets. At present, the company is operating at 70 per cent capacity. With the timely expansion, the company is expected to gain market share in the aforementioned regions. Cement prices in the northern region have been higher than the last year. The company the second-largest white cement producer in India (0.6 MTPA), is expected to benefit since demand in white cement has recovered well in the past few quarters. In the next two fiscals, analysts estimate 17-22 per cent growth in its earnings per share (EPS), thereby making it one of the attractive bets among mid-sized cement companies.

Bought by: Nippon India MF
Superior cost control, better than-expected improvement in margins thanks to gain in market share, network expansion in rural areas and strong brand equity among consumers have helped boost revenue of the company in the September 2020 quarter. According to analysts, there has been a pronounced improvement in demand for lighting and agri-pump products which will drive future revenues for the company. The company has benefited from strong growth in e-commerce buying and demand for consumer products in rural areas. Analysts believe that there is enough scope for the company’s inventory levels to rise further from the present level. They have raised the company’s EPS estimates in the range of 17-25 per cent for the next two fiscals

Fund managers believe SBI is well-positioned to report strong earnings growth as the impact of Covid 19 moderates and the economy picks up. They believe NPL formation has moderated significantly while the strong pipeline of accounts under recovery will help further improvement. While most other PSBs have lost market share in the retail space, the bank has improved its share in both loans as well as deposits. Analysts believe its superior franchise will see it gain incremental market share in the current environment. An added advantage is that its subsidiaries — SBI MF, SBI Life Insurance, SBI General Insurance and SBI Cards — have displayed robust performances and gained scale and market share in their respective segments"

Speaking at a webinar, the market veteran said benchmark equity Sensex was somewhere around the 800-mark in 1987-88 when he joined the markets. Now, it is hovering at record high levels of over 44,500 levels. This shows the index has managed to deliver over 13 per cent CAGR return (without counting dividends) despite some major hiccups like the Kargil War, Global Financial Crisis and change in governments, among others.

“Time spent with high quality businesses is more important than timing the market,” Damani said, adding that India is aspiring to become the third largest economy from a Third World country.

The ace stock-picker said there are lots of opportunities in every sector, including retail, cement and technologies. “Investors who have stayed bullish on this country and invested in high quality businesses have made a fortune,” he said.

Historical data of blue chip companies, which are a part of the BSE Sensex now, shows players like Bajaj Finance have rallied 1,86,303 per cent over the past 20 years. Titan, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Asian Paints, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and L&T have gained between 5,500 per cent and 52,500 per cent during this period.

Other players like HDFC, IndusInd Bank, M&M, Sun Pharma, Nestle India, RIL, ICICI Bank, SBI, HUL and ITC also gained between 1,000 per cent and 4,500 per cent since November 2020.

So have the rules of investing changed now? Damani said the Law of Gravity cannot change. The same thing applies to the rule of investing. These are the universal principles.

“To pick the right stock, you have to buy good business with some margin of safety. Investors should also invest with a long-term view and pay less than what you expect a few years from now. These principles will never change,” he said.

Damani highlighted the fact that the market moves between fear and greed and this pendulum keeps on swinging. Therefore, the concept of buying with a margin of safety is never going to change.

Sharing tips for novice investors, he said one should understand the value of compounding and start early. “Compounding is the surest thing to make you rich. The earlier you start, the better off you are,” he said."

Sun Pharma,"Nov 20, 2020, 01:52 PM IST",Warren Buffett's firm buying big into drug stocks. Should you too?,"NEW DELHI: Legendary investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has invested in four large drugmakers in the recent months.

Latest investment data showed the Nebraska-based company bought into Merck & Co, Pfizer, Abbvie and Bristol-Myers Squibb during the September quarter. This has made domestic investors wonder whether domestic pharma stocks can still more returns on the back of the recent strong rally.

While there are concerns as to whether pharma stocks are fully pricing in a Covid windfall, analysts suggest Indian pharma isn’t just a Covid theme, but beyond that. They still find many pharma stocks that can be bought at current levels.

Nomura India has cut its weightage on the pharma sector, but still holds an overweight rating on it. In its latest equity strategy report, the brokerage said the earnings upcycle in frontline pharma companies -- after a significant downcycle over last 4-5 years -- is here to stay.

The brokerage said the market would attribute higher valuation multiples to the pharma stocks, as there is further earnings visibility over next 12 months.

The brokerage has limited its top picks to the frontline companies with sustained earnings recovery, such as Dr Reddy’s Labs, Lupin and Sun Pharma. It has removed Jubilant Life Sciences and Glenmark Pharma from its portfolio.

Data showed the Sun Pharma stock has gained 63 per cent from its 52-week low of Rs 315 hit on March 23, but is still down 57 per cent from its April 2015 highs, as per the adjusted price data available with AceEquity.

In the broader market, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty have been hitting new highs every other day.

Lupin shares have climbed 79 per cent since March 19 but are down 57.4 per cent from its October 2015 levels.

The stock of Dr Reddy’s, meanwhile, hit a fresh record of Rs 5,514.65 but is still trading 11 per cent below those levels. Jubilant Life Sciences has recovered 206 per cent from its 52-week lows, while Glenmark has gained 189 per cent. The two stocks are down 30-60 per cent from their lifetime highs.

“Covid-19 might have given pharma an additional tailwind, which got reflected over the past quarters and might even show up in a couple of quarters more to come, but that will normalise going forward. The domestic pharma companies have done a wonderful job in cutting costs. There might be some bunching up of orders partially due to Covid, but the undeniable fact is India is fast emerging as a generic powerhouse,” he said. 

Dharamshi said the pharma pack may see some consolidation rather than a steep correction in the pharma sector, until the story starts picking up again. “We are not very sure what percentage of growth that we have witnessed in the past couple of quarters will sustain. Once the market gets a better sense of that, there will be more to come. Pharma can give very good returns even from here on,” he said. 

Credit Suisse said India aims to administer 40-50 crore vaccine doses by July-2021. The key vaccines India is banking on are from Oxford/AstraZeneca, Novavax and J&J (temperature range is 2-8°C) and the earliest efficacy data is expected by end of November 2020 and December 2020, while vaccines can be rolled out in January in the best-case scenario.

The global brokerage said Aurobindo’s large viral vector vaccine facility (30 crore doses) should be ready by March-April next year. “The pricing could be higher in the export markets than in India, and profitability could be at Rs 20-25 per dose. Therefore, on a 30 crore dose capacity, Aurobindo could benefit from a potential Ebitda of Rs 600-750 crore, which would be 12-15 per cent of FY22 Ebitda,” it said. This brokerage has upgraded Aurobindo stock to ‘outperform’ from ‘neutral’.

It said Cadila also has a facility to make 10 crore doses, but it is for DNA vaccine and, therefore, it would not be able to manufacture vaccine from global players in the near term. “Cipla and Cadila have benefitted the most from the sale of Covid-19 treatment drugs (especially Remdesivir) during the September quarter and volume should drop substantially in FY22 on rise in vaccination,” CS said.

Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Corporate Finance, wants to play the M&A theme in the pharma space with Tier-II stocks.

“You will not find the kind of returns coming from Sun and Dr Reddy’s; they will disappoint you. Shift your portfolio down to tier-II pharma companies more on the manufacturing side, which are going to get a major boost including the PLI. Do not lose hope on pharma. It is there to stay and you will get lots of good surprises from takeovers. PE players are gunning for those companies. Buy and keep, and you will get an offer very soon in the mail,” he said."

Sun Pharma,"Nov 20, 2020, 12:11 PM IST",9 Nifty stocks 100-340% down from peak prices: Should you buy?,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmark Nifty might have made an all-time high at 12,948 this week, but hitting such record levels seems like a distant dream for nine index stocks, which need to gain 100-338 per cent to revisit their previous peaks.

Many of these stocks are on analysts’ ‘buy’ list, though none of them promises to make fresh highs for now, if one were go by analyst targets.


ONGC: This stock settled at Rs 71.90 on Wednesday and needs a 338 per cent rally to revisit its all-time high of Rs 314 hit on June 9, 2014. BoB Capital Markets said the stock’s underperformance despite the recent rise in oil prices provides valuation comfort, especially amid the decline in operating costs.

“As oil prices remain strong, we find the risk-reward favourable and upgrade the earnings estimates. As cash flows improve amid a decline in leverage, we see a strong probability of either higher dividend payout or share buyback going forward,” the brokerage said. It suggested a price target of Rs 104 on the stock. Edelweiss has a price target of Rs 100. Motilal Oswal Securities sees the stock at Rs 90 while IDBI Capital has a target of Rs 85.


Coal India: Coal India requires a 270 per cent rally to hit the August 2015 high of Rs 447. This stock is a ‘buy’ for Emkay Global, but with a lower target price of Rs 180 against Rs 208 earlier amid concerns over low e-auction premiums.

Taking cognisance of lower cash accretion, Edelweiss has cut its price target for Coal India to Rs 155 from Rs 165.
The stock closed at Rs 120.75 on Wednesday. “Realisations from e-auction and volume growth have been under pressure on account of a decline in power demand and significant stocks at both mines and power plants. However, power demand has shown signs of improvement, and we expect volumes to recover in 2HFY21,” Motilal Oswal said and recommended a price target of Rs 192 on the stock.


Tata Motors: The stock needs a 249 per cent rise over its Wednesday’s price to revisit the February 2015 high of Rs 605 apiece. HDFC Securities last week upgraded the stock to ‘Buy’ rating from ‘Add’, as it expects the OEM to benefit from improving demand outlook, cost-cutting initiatives and better FCF generation. “JLR’s retail volumes are improving from Covid lows, and system inventories are normalising,” it said and recommended a price target of Rs 175 on the stock. Phillip Capital said the company has turned the corner and the worst is behind it. This brokerage has a price target of Rs 167 on the stock. The stock traded at Rs 173 on Wednesday, suggesting muted upside potential. 


NTPC: NTPC needs a 174 per cent gain to reach its March January 2008 high. Analysts have a ‘strong buy’ recommendation on the stock. In a recent note, IIFL said NTPC valuations are very undemanding at 0.7 times FY21E PBV and it comes with an attractive dividend yield of 6.4 per cent. “The regulated RoE of 15.5 per cent till FY24E and commercialisation of capacities provide good earnings visibility and will lend support to the stock price,” it said. Kotak Securities finds the fair value of the stock at Rs 125. The stock closed at Rs 88.30 on Wednesday.


IndianOil: IOC requires a 172 per cent jump to hit the August 2017 high. JP Morgan has March 2021 price target of Rs 140 on the stock, while UBS’s 12-month target stands at Rs 130 and Prabhudas Lilladher’s at Rs 118. IOC hit a record high of Rs 231.47 on August 31 2017, as per corporate database AceEquity.

Nirmal Bang’s buy call on IOC is based on improved outlook for retail margins, a likely recovery in refining and petchem margins in next 1-2 years due to likely closure of capacities and compelling valuation after a sharp 45 per cent drop in the stock price in last one year, which has priced in worries over margins and the likely risk of rising competition from private retailers/alternative fuels.


IndusInd Bank: At Rs 828, shares of IndusInd Bank are trading higher than JM Financial’s price target for the stock at Rs 750, Nomura’s target of Rs 725 and Edelweiss’ target of Rs 665. Up 125 per cent in the last six months, this stock is still down 45 per cent year to date. Edelweiss said concerns over asset quality will dominate IndusInd’s core business momentum gains in the foreseeable future. “Demonstration of the merger value-add and getting through the current crisis without earnings erosion thereof are key,” it said.


Sun Pharma: ICICI Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 610. Prabhudas Lilladher sees the stock at Rs 597, JPMorgan at Rs 600, JM Financial at Rs 770 and Macquarie at Rs 620. The stock has 32 ‘buy’, 2 ‘hold’ and 5 ‘sell’ ratings. 

Emkay Global said while the company management has indicated that the reduction in sales and promotional expenses is not structural, it expects the Ebitda margin to remain at around 25 per cent in the near term, as other expenses are likely to moderate in third and possibly fourth quarters. This brokerage has a price target of Rs 560 on the stock. Specialty sales growth, Halol plant resolution and recovery in the branded markets are seen as key driver for the Sun Pharma stock, analysts said.


GAIL: Prabhudas Lilladher expects GAIL’s capex trajectory to pick up as all businesses (excluding pipeline) operate at near-peak levels. A weak commodity price outlook amid uncertain demand recovery remains a key risk, it said and suggested a price target of Rs 108 on the stock. IDBI Capital has a price target of Rs 109 on the stock while JM Financial sees it at Rs 125.

“Given the weakness in share price, the prevailing market price is implying zero value for its gas trading and petchem/LPG businesses due to low earnings visibility. “Hence, we maintain a buy rating as the valuation provides a margin of safety,” JM Financial said.


ITC: Antique, IIFL, Elara, Jefferies, Kotak Institutional Equities and CLSA, among others, have ‘buy’ ratings on the stock with price targets ranging from Rs 235 to Rs 273. At 14.5 times FY22 earnings, the stock valuation appears to be compelling while a higher payout implies an attractive 5 per cent dividend yield, Jefferies said and maintained a price target of Rs 265 on the stock.

Geojit expects an improvement across ITC’s verticals in the months ahead. “However, the pace of pickup in volumes and demand remains crucial,” it said as it valued the stock at Rs 217."

Rising Covid cases: A skittish mood swept investors as several US states began restricting gatherings and mandating face-coverings after more than 70,000 Americans were hospitalised for treatment of COVID-19 as of Monday, according to a Reuters tally of public health figures.


Disappointing US retail sales data: US retail sales increased less than expected in October and could slow further, restrained by spiralling new Covid-19 infections and declining household income as millions of unemployed Americans lose government financial support. US retail sales rose 0.3 per cent last month, the smallest gain since the recovery started in May, after increasing 1.6 per cent in September, the US Commerce Department said.

""This formation, which usually reflects exhausted bulls, gets formed around potential turning points.

The markets took a breather on Thursday after eight consecutive days of gains. The Nifty50 remained in a narrow range of 120 points and formed a Doji candle on the daily chart. We can say that this is a consolidation window that the Nifty has opened and is preparing to move to the level of 12,950-13,000 on the eve of Diwali.

Sun Pharma,"Nov 03, 2020, 09:12 PM IST","Sun Pharma Q2 takeaways: Debt comes down, R&D spends increase & more","NEW DELHI: Drug major Sun Pharma surprised the Street, performing better than expected during the September quarter, and also managed to decrease its debt level.

Emerging markets and the rest of the world markets were the main drivers behind the company’s growth during the quarter. Analysts believe the performance will give a boost to shares of the company that have seen undeserving selling.

Here are the key takeaways from the earnings:


What has been the growth in Indian market?Sale of branded formulations in India for Q2 was Rs 2,531 crore, up by 1 per cent over Q2 last year and up by 6 per cent over Q1FY21, accounting for 30 per cent of total sales. “Sun Pharma holds approximately 8.1 per cent market share in the over Rs 1,42,000 crore Indian pharmaceutical market as per AIOCD AWACS MAT September-2020 report,” said the firm.

During the September quarter, the company launched 22 new products in the Indian market.


How did it perform overseas?US: Sales in the US (including subsidiary Taro) were $335 million, flat over Q2 last year and up by 19 per cent compared to Q1FY21, accounting for about 30 per cent of total consolidated sales.

EM: Sales in emerging markets were at $210 million for the quarter, a growth of 4.5 per cent over Q2 last year and up by 21 per cent over Q1FY21.

Rest of the world: Formulation sales in Rest of World (ROW) markets were $178 million in Q2FY21, up by 10 per cent over Q2 last year and up by 31 per cent compared to Q1FY21, accounting for approximately 16 per cent of total consolidated sales.


What has been the growth in API business?External sales of API were at Rs 510 crore, a growth of 9 per cent over Q2 last year and lower by 8 per cent compared to Q1FY21.


How much did the company spend on R&D?Consolidated R&D investment for the quarter was Rs 613 crore, or 7.2 per cent of sales, as compared to Rs 488 crore (6.1 per cent of sales) for Q2 last year. For the first half, R&D expense was Rs 1,033 crore, or 6.5 per cent of sales.


What is the update on debt payment?The company has said it has repaid debt of over $300 million in H1FY21 compared to the debt as of March 31, 2020. Consequently, the debt to equity ratio came down to 0.13 per cent from 0.18 at the end of March.


Management's take:“Our Q2 performance reflects our focus on business improvement which has enabled a gradual recovery in all our businesses compared to Q1, despite market conditions that have not fully normalized. Sales of our specialty products have improved sequentially with Ilumya and Cequa reaching pre-Covid levels. We continue to focus on growing our topline, gaining market share, cost control and business continuity. We also continue to serve our patients and customers while ensuring safety of our employees,” Sun Pharmaceutical Industries MD Dilip Shanghvi said.


Analyst's take:“These numbers are much-much better than what the market was expecting and it is way above consensus. Perhaps their speciality products saw more traction than expected. I always felt that Sun Pharma was beaten down much more than it deserved. It was clearly in an oversold territory and people were writing off Sun Pharma,” said Sudip Bandyopadhyay of Inditrade Capital."

Its total revenue from operations rose 5.29 per cent to Rs 8,553.13 crore, from Rs 8,123.35 crore.

However, Nifty’s high/low range was confined to 101 points, which is its lowest daily range since 23 October (if we exclude Diwali Muhurat trading band).

Grasim Inds.,"Nov 12, 2020, 06:53 PM IST",India company profits rebound after worst decline in a decade,"By Ishika Mookerjee
Profits at Indian companies have rebounded from the worst decline in at least a decade amid signs of an economic recovery.

Aggregate net income of 46 NSE Nifty 50 members grew 4.8 per cent from a year earlier in the quarter through September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About two-thirds of the earnings beat or matched analyst estimates, compared with double-digit profit declines in the two previous quarters. By contrast, combined profit for MSCI Asia Pacific constituents remains below year-ago levels.

BloombergLenders including ICICI Bank Ltd. and technology firms such as Infosys Ltd. are among those that beat estimates, signaling business conditions are recovering faster than analysts had predicted. Still, while cost-cuts shored up operating profits, sales dipped for many companies from a year ago and the central bank cautioned risks remain even as prospects brightened in October.

“The worst seems to be over with regards to earnings for corporate India,” said Abhimanyu Sofat, head of research at IIFL Securities Ltd. “Companies are cutting costs, discretionary spending has rebounded, and a broad-based recovery is driving markets.”

India’s emergence from the world’s biggest lockdown triggered a revival in demand, even as Asia’s third-largest economy may contract this year for the first time in about four decades. A combination of better-than-expected earnings, completion of U.S. presidential voting and progress toward a Covid-19 vaccine helped propel the Nifty 50 index to new highs for the first three days this week.

Earnings estimates for the Nifty 50 members have climbed by about 11 per cent from a July low, and the gauge is trading at its highest ever price-to-estimated earnings multiple. Still, analysts expect the index to rise about 8 per cent from Wednesday’s close within a year. Tata Steel Ltd., Oil & Natural Gas Corp., Eicher Motors Ltd. and Grasim Industries Ltd. are scheduled to announce results by the end of this week.

While India has the world’s second-largest coronavirus case count, new daily infections are less than half the peak in mid-September, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.


Key highlights


Energy and financials posted the best profit growth on average.
State-run refiner Indian Oil Corp.’s net income of 62.3 billion rupees ($840 million) compares with 5.63 billion rupees a year earlier as its refineries operated at an average capacity of 93 per cent.
Materials and consumer discretionary companies posted the biggest earnings surprises.
Most banks beat estimates, buoyed by interest income and lower provisioning as retail lending recovered.
ICICI Bank Ltd. posted a record quarterly profit as it set aside fewer provisions for bad loans.
Continuing a trend seen in the previous quarter, four of India’s five biggest technology companies beat earnings estimates as clients’ IT spending recovered.
Bharti Airtel Ltd. posted one of the biggest earnings disappointments: a surprise quarterly loss as competition hindered tariff increases.


Analyst comments


Analysts expect banks, among the biggest laggards this year, and IT shares to gain as the economy improves and companies continue to digitize their operations.
“The economic recovery continues and Covid-19 cases have seen a meaningful decline,” said Gautam Duggad, head of research at Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. The brokerage remains overweight on IT, banks, health care, telecom and automotive stocks

On a year-to-date basis, shares of Dhunseri Tea have advanced 48 per cent till date, while Grasim and Just Dial have declined 3 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively.

Grasim Industries continues to maintain a comfortable level of liquidity to navigate the uncertain business environment, company's chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said on Monday.

“The inherent financial strength, operational excellence, and diverse product portfolio with cement, financial services, viscose, chemicals, and other businesses makes your company well prepared to withstand temporary disruptions and sustain its leadership across its portfolio,” Birla told shareholders at the 73rd Annual General Meeting (AGM) of Grasim Industries.

Any rise in promoter holding in an equity, that too in a tough environment, is considered good omen, as it shows insiders’ the commitment to their businesses and confidence on future growth prospects."
Grasim Inds.,"Sep 15, 2020, 09:09 AM IST","Economy normalising, Grasim businesses operating at 80% capacity: Kumar Mangalam Birla","Mumbai: India’s economic activity levels are normalising after a steep fall in the first quarter due to Covid-19 setback, underlining that the country’s long-term growth potential remains intact, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said on Monday.

“Both the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Government of India have announced several policy measures to provide relief to the affected sections of the economy and to support the process of recovery,” Birla told shareholders of Grasim Industries at the group flagship’s 73rd annual general meeting held through videoconference. 

He said both viscose staple fibre (VSF) and chemicals businesses of Grasim are now operating at about 80% of pre-Covid capacity, after a low of 23% witnessed in April. “We expect to be back to pre-Covid capacity by Q4,” Birla said.

He said the company has decided to go ahead with its Rs 3,523-crore VSF brownfield expansion in Gujarat with revised timelines. “The company’s capex plan for FY21 has been calibrated to Rs 1,615 crore as of now,” he said. 

India’s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted a record 23.9% year on year in the first quarter ended June when most of the country was under lockdown to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Birla, however, pointed out that the economic activity levels have been gradually normalising since then.

“The IMF (International Monetary Fund) also has estimated that the Indian economy will rebound to 6% in FY22,” he said. “The government’s move to promote domestic champions through the Atmanirbhar Bharat programme is commendable.” 

To overcome the slowdown in the economy, Grasim has initiated measures to optimise operations across plants, reduce fixed costs and conserve cash to overcome the slowdown in business activity.

“Given the uncertain business environment, Grasim’s current strategic focus is built on four pillars – demand creation through innovative products, cost rationalisation, agility, and cash flow focus,” Birla said.

Across the businesses, the company's fixed costs have reduced by 35%, which amounts to savings of Rs 256 crore compared to the FY20 quarterly average, he said.

The company has businesses as diverse as cement, chemicals and VSF.

Grasim had reported a 72% year-on-year decline in its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended June at Rs 353 crore against Rs 1,294 crore a year earlier. 

“Based on your company’s performance and future outlook, your directors have recommended a dividend of Rs 4 per equity share of face value of Rs 2 each for FY20. This entails a cash outgo of Rs 263 crore,"" Birla told the shareholders.

Its consolidated revenue from operations stood at Rs 77,625 crore for 2019-20 while its consolidated Ebitda was at Rs 13,846 crore.

Almost all of Grasim’s plants and corporate offices were shut for several weeks in compliance with the government directives as part of a national lockdown starting from the last week of March to contain the spread of the pandemic. 

The Indian economy delivered a subdued performance in the last fiscal year when GDP growth slipped to 4.2% from 6.1% in 2018-19, primarily led by manufacturing and construction sector weakness."
Grasim Inds.,"Sep 08, 2020, 08:50 AM IST",Will Voda funding hit Grasim’s valuation?,"Mumbai: Morgan Stanley said if Grasim Industries contributes more capital to its group telecom venture — Vodafone Idea (VIL) — it could lead to the cement major’s holding company discount widening. Grasim owns 11.55% stake in Vodafone Idea and has sizeable holdings in most Aditya Birla Group companies.

Vodafone Idea on Friday approved raising up to 25,000 crore through equity and debt. The move is expected to reduce promoters’ stake in the telecom operator. Vodafone owns 53.57% and the Aditya Birla Group holds 18.48% stake in the company.

“This announcement could also raise similar concerns as during the last fundraising (through rights issue) Grasim contributed its share of 11.55% of the total amount,” said Morgan Stanley in a recent report. So far, the group has not announced that Grasim would participate in the fundraising. Grasim shares shed 0.90% to close at 700.10 on Monday.

“Any large-scale investment in the group company appears a low probability event to us although it cannot be ruled out. If Grasim doesn’t contribute any capital, we think it will be construed positively,” said Morgan Stanley."

The decision was taken for ""the rationalisation and simplification of the corporate structure of the Pininfarina Group"" and the unit was no longer ""considered strategic"" for the development of the group, Pininfarina said in a press statement dated 26 October.

Pininfarina Engineering offered a variety of work package engineering services and end-to-end vehicle development services.

“The development services segment has shrunk beyond any forecast and given these unprecedented times and the global economic uncertainties brought on by Covid-19, Pininfarina Group had to rationalise its corporate structure to strengthen the company and at the same time provide clients guaranteed service excellence across all verticals,” Silvio Angori, managing director of Pinanfarina S.p.A., said in an emailed response to ET’s queries.

Tech Mahindra acquired the automotive design firm Pininfarina in 2015 and holds about 76% stake in it. The company has designed cars for iconic carmakers like Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Maserati and Peugeot.

Mahindra group said that Pininfarina will remain focused on its core competencies of design and engineering.

About 135 jobs are on the line and the affected employees took to the main square at Turin, where the company is based, to protest the liquidation, local media reported.

Trade unions and Pininfarina management have reached an agreement to relocate about 70 employees to the parent company and to another Turin-based company, according to a report from Corriere Torino.

“We fail to understand why the company cannot be reorganised and managed in a way that has competitive costs. We cannot believe that for Pininfarina Engineering Srl there are no more profit margins, as the top management claims,” read an open letter from the protesting employees to Mahindra Group's top management.

“We do not understand how this decision fits in with the ethical and social guidelines always declared by the Mahindra Group and its president.”

The employees also wrote a letter to the Italian Minister of labour and social policies Giuliano Poletti

Angori said that most of the employees were offered job opportunities by the Pininfarina Group and by some of its suppliers while some of the others were offered an outplacement service to help them to secure job positions elsewhere. “Resources that would not find outside employment will be supported for the next 3 years through unemployment benefits and financial compensation.”"

The index gained for the third consecutive week while maintaining higher high-low signalling continuation of the positive bias. Going ahead, we expect the Nifty to extend the ongoing up move and head towards 13,200 in the coming weeks as it is the measuring implication of the recent consolidation range breakout (12,000-10,800 = 1,200 points). 

The ongoing rally in Nifty from October lows (1,428 points) is now stronger in magnitude than early October rally (1,235 points). Extending rallies and shallow intermediate corrections is an indication of robust price structure. Market breadth has seen significant improvement as currently average 87 per cent components of Nifty midcap and small cap indices are trading above 200 days SMA compared to last week’s reading of 79 per cent, highlighting strength and durability of ongoing up move.

Buy Biocon


CMP: Rs 420
Target: Rs 460
Stop loss: Rs 398
Rationale:


In the current leg of the Nifty rally, no major contribution was seen from the pharma space, which largely consolidated and saw accumulation of positions at lower levels. Biocon, in particular, reverted from its highest Put base of 400 and largely consolidated above this level along with closure in OI. 
However, for the December series, the OI is increasing at a decent pace and the stock is stable near Rs 420 levels. Delivery based volumes were seen near Rs 405 and Rs 410 levels at the start of the series, after which the stock moved higher.

Buy Torrent Power


CMP: Rs 311
Target: Rs 330
Stop loss: Rs 297
Rationale:


Torrent Power has not been able to perform in line with the market and remained largely range bound in the last couple of months. However, open interest in the stock continues to increase and it is at the highest levels seen since March 2020. We believe short covering should take the stock higher from current levels. 
From the options space, closure among heavily written ATM Call strikes is visible and further recovery towards Rs 330 levels is expected in the stock in the towards settlement.

Analyst Name: Dharmesh Shah – Head Technical
The weekly price action formed a sizable bull candle carrying higher high-low. The benchmark index continued its positive momentum on Monday and registered a fresh all-time high (11,474). The Nifty in the process retraced its three-week decline (12,025-11,535) in just a single week, signifying structural improvement. 

Going ahead, we expect the index to maintain a positive bias and extend the up move towards 12,750 levels in the coming weeks being the price parity with the previous rally (10,790 to 12,025) from the recent trough (10,535). We expect a broader market to witness catch up activity and outperform in the coming weeks. 

The Nifty Midcap has resolved out of two months consolidation and the market breadth has seen significant improvement as currently average 71 per cent components of Nifty midcap and smallcap indices are trading above its 200 days SMA compared to last week’s average reading of 65 per cent.

Buy: Mahanagar Gas


CMP: Rs 850
Target: Rs 890
Stop loss: Rs 825
Rationale:


In the current up move, most of the beaten down stocks did well and observed sharp pullbacks. MGL has been consolidating above Rs 800 levels for a couple of weeks after witnessing continued decline in the last few months. It has witnessed a huge addition of short positions in the October series, which has been rolled into November series.
Recent closure in short OI was seen in the stock suggesting an expected up move in the short term. With upcoming quarterly results, we believe short covering might find some pace. 


Buy Infosys


CMP: Rs 1,130
Target: 1,180
Stop loss: 1,090
Rationale:


After a sharp rally in the technology space, a leg of profit booking was seen post the quarterly numbers. Stocks like Infosys saw fresh long OI blocks in the November series. The stock managed to move and sustain above 1,100 levels. 
As the series progressed, Call writers shifted their position to OTM strike of 1,200 whereas sizeable Put OI is placed at 1,100, which should be considered as a re-entry opportunity to create long. We feel the current leg of long accumulation in the stock would continue and the stock is well-placed to move towards its lifetime high levels.

The weekly price action formed a bear candle with a lower high-low after a sharp rally of 11% in one-month (10790-12025) indicating profit booking around the psychological 12000 mark. Historically, volatility has remained elevated during US Presidential Election. During such a volatile phase we expect the Nifty to find strong support around 11000-11200 range as it is confluence of the 100 days EMA and 80% retracement of Sept- Oct rally (11790-12025). 

We expect the Nifty to hold above the crucial support area post US election outcome. Therefore, any dips from here on should be capitalised as an incremental buying opportunity as the medium term structure remains positive

F&0 Strategy:

Buy Federal Bank


CMP: 51.75
Target: 56
Stop loss: 47.8
Rationale:


Banking stocks are exhibiting significant out performance in last few weeks as profit booking is seen among weakness seen in technology, pharma and energy stocks. Stocks like Federal Bank have witnessed a round of profit booking after its quarterly results. Currently stock is trading near its major Put base indicating expectations of limited downsides.
At the same time, the open interest in the stock has risen continuously since last month as fresh longs are added in it. We believe ongoing positive bias should take the stock higher towards 58 levels in the days to come.


Short Butterfly Strategy Bharti Airtel


Strategy: 


Short Bharti November 450 Call and 450 Put at cumulative premium of 40-42 
Buy November 480 Call at 9-10
Buy November 420 Put at 7-8
Rationale:


Bharti Airtel has been extreme volatile in last couple of months and the current option premiums are reflecting the same. The current options premium for ATM strike is almost 10%, which covers the range of almost 40 points from current levels. However, to protect from unwarranted sharp moves in either directions, we advise forming short butterfly spread.
One can sell ATM Call and Put strikes of 450 for November series and at the same time to protect sharp directional moves, buying in deep OTM options are recommended where once can buy 480 Call and 420 Put for the current series.

Tech Mahindra,"Oct 23, 2020, 07:24 PM IST","Tech Mahindra Q2 takeaways: BFSI, technology verticals drive revenue growth","NEW DELHI: IT major Tech Mahindra continued the trend of its peers and beat Street estimates for September quarter earnings. However, the growth was in low single digits which could be a cause of worry.

Communications, its biggest business vertical, suffered and revenue from that came down by 5 per cent, while BFSI and technology verticals saw robust growth. The company also announced acquisition of two companies.


Here are key takeaways from the Q2 numbers:

How much did the company earn?Tech Mahindra posted a 5.27 per cent year-on-year (YoY) fall in net profit at Rs 1,064.60 crore while consolidated revenue increased 3.32 per cent YoY to Rs 9,371.80 crore.

In dollar terms, revenue of the company declined 1.7 per cent YoY to $1,265.40 million. However, the figure increased by 4.80 per cent on a QoQ basis. Ebitda grew 13.46 per cent YoY to Rs 1,703 crore.


Which business segment saw growth?BFSI and Technology, Media & Entertainment verticals were outperformers. The former which contributes 16 per cent to revenue, saw a growth of 25 per cent in business, while the latter that contributes about 10 per cent to Tech Mahindra’s revenue grew by 18 per cent YoY. 


Which business segment did not perform well?Communications and manufacturing segments did not perform well and revenue growth dropped. Communications that brings nearly 40 per cent of its revenue suffered a drop of 5.8 per cent, while manufacturing vertical that contributes 16 per cent of the revenue suffered 12 per cent YoY drop.


Did the company announce any dividend?The board of Tech Mahindra proposed a special dividend of Rs 15 per share.


What are the companies it acquired?Tech Mahindra also announced the strategic acquisition of Momenton, a digital enterprise technology firm, offering consultancy and implementation services, and Tenzing Limited, a technology consulting company.

“Tech Mahindra has acquired 100 per cent equity in both the organizations, and together they will enable digital capabilities, modern cloud-based architecture and transformation for customers in the ANZ (Australia and New Zealand), specifically in financial services,” said the company.


How many clients did it add?The company added two $20 million plus clients, one $10 million plus clients, four $5 million plus clients and nine $1 million plus clients during the quarter. However, it did not add any $50 million plus clients.


Management's take:“Strong execution on both revenue growth and operational metrics has helped to improve our
performance on all fronts. Our cash conversion continues to be robust and we remain committed towards creating value for our shareholders through effective capital return,” said Manoj Bhat, Chief Financial Officer, Tech Mahindra.

Valuation:The company is one of the least expensive large cap IT companies, trading at 17.41 times its earnings at Rs 948.10. In terms of price to book value, the multiple stands at 3.64. Return on Equity (RoE) stands at 20.50 per cent."
Larsen & Toubro,"Dec 17, 2020, 10:20 AM IST",6 stocks seeing profit margin growth for 4 straight quarters,"NEW DELHI: Six companies from the BSE500 pack have reported growth in profit margins for back-to-back four quarters. Five of these stocks have climbed up to 356 per cent so far this year, against a 12 per cent rise in the Sensex. They include Laurus Labs, Divi’s Laboratories, Mindtree, Aegis Logistics and Ambuja Cements. The sixth stock, Vakrangee, is up 6 per cent this year.

The margin gains for these firms in the last four quarters were in the 5-13 percentage points range.

Laurus Labs’ PAT margin stood at 21.27 per cent in September quarter compared with 17.73 per cent in June quarter, 13.12 per cent in March quarter, 10.07 per cent in the December quarter of 2019 and 7.93 per cent in the September quarter of 2019. The stock is up 356 per cent so far this year.

Laurus has a portfolio with more than 60 commercialised APIs with strong presence in antiretroviral, oncology, anti-diabetic and Hepatitis-C therapeutic segments. The company forayed into the formulation business on a large scale in FY20, resulting in major revenue gains from that segment i.e. about 29 per cent in FY20 against about 2 per cent during FY19.

""Based on growth visibility in the formulations business as well as in the API segment, we are confident of sustaining the earnings momentum. The company is well positioned for long-term growth,"" said Anand Rathi Financial Services.

Divi’s Labs has seen margin rise 5.02 percentage points to 28.43 per cent in the September quarter from 24.68 per cent in the year-ago period. This stock is up 95 per cent for 2020 so far.

""Divi’s, over the year, has emerged as a preferred partner for several key customers for synthesis projects, with expertise in scaling up high tonnage products. The custom synthesis business is a margin accretive one, but at times it is lumpy in nature. However, as of the September quarter, the business showed good recovery on account of an improved business environment,"" Sharekhan said.

Strong earnings visibility, almost zero debt and strong return ratios bode well for the company from a growth perspective. Besides, the company does not have any pending regulatory hurdles, which is a key positive, analysts said.

Mindtree shares have rallied 80 per cent this calendar. Margins grew 6.1 percentage points to 13.17 per cent at the end of the September quarter from 7.05 per cent in the year-ago period.

ICICI Securities said there is no management plan for a merger between L&T Infotech and Mindtree. The brokerage sees steady PAT margin of 14.5 per cent by FY23. This is when Mindtree’s cost structure should become identical to that of L&T Infotech, it said.

“A higher share of fixed price projects and continued focus on tail account rationalisation should be key margin drivers for the company. Multiples are undemanding at 19 times FY22 EPS on our estimates, as we have already factored in the potential for further margin surprise,"" ICICI Securities said.

Aegis Logistics is also seeing an improvement in margins. The company, which reported losses for the September quarter of 2019, has gradually increased PAT margin to 9.86 per cent at the end of the September quarter of 2020. The rise in margin for this company was due to continued strong performance by the liquids division and revival of the gas logistics business. The company is expecting a jump in gas throughput by 2.0 mmtpa in next two years. The stock has three ‘buy’ calls and two ‘outperform’ calls as of today, as per publicly available data with Reuters.

Ambuja Cements’ PAT margin improved to 12.97 per cent in the September quarter from 8.70 per cent in the year-ago quarter. The stock had 12 'buy' calls and 13 'outperform' calls as of Tuesday, December 15. It also had 9 'hold' and 2 'sell' calls. September was Ambuja Cements’ third quarter straight consistent outperformance vis-a-vis Street expectations. Analysts see the stock as a potential re-rating candidate.

Vakrangee, meanwhile, gained a mere 6 per cent this year despite seeing a 11.79 percentage points surge in margins. That said, the stock is up 206 per cent over its 52-week low of Rs 17.10 hit in April."
Larsen & Toubro,"Dec 14, 2020, 09:10 PM IST",Ahead of Market: 12 things that will decide stock action on Tuesday,"NEW DELHI: Nifty ended above the 13,550 level on Monday but formed a Doji candle on the daily chart, hinting indecision in the markets.

Rohit Singre of LKP Securities said, the Nifty has formed a good base near 13,500-13,440 zone.

""We may see bullish momentum to continue towards immediate hurdle zone of 13,600-13,650 zone. Below 13,400 zone we may see some immediate trend reversal. Support for Nifty Bank is coming near 30,500-30,200 zone and resistance is coming near 31,000-31,200 zone,"" he said.

Vinod Nair of Geojit Financial Services said, the domestic market is expected to gain its momentum from the global market, due to an eventful week ahead with Britain and the EU moving for a no-deal Brexit and the US markets awaiting the outcome of the Fed meeting.

Gaurav Ratnaparkhi of Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said, though the upside momentum has weakened in the last few sessions, the bulls are managing to hold on the support parameters.

""Hence, as long as the Nifty trades above the support zone of 13,450-13,400, it is expected to stretch towards 13,700,"" he said.


That said, here’s a look at what some of the key indicators are suggesting for Tuesday's action:
US stocks cheered by vaccine roll-outWall Street's main indexes rose on Monday as travel stocks surged on the launch of a nationwide COVID-19 vaccine campaign, while Alexion Pharmaceuticals jumped on a $39 billion buyout offer from AstraZeneca in one of the year's biggest deals. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 242.50 points, or 0.81%, at 30,288.87, the S&P 500 was up 31.31 points, or 0.85%, at 3,694.77, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 126.03 points, or 1.02%, at 12,503.91.


European shares cheer Brexit trade talks extensionEuropean shares rose on Monday, as a decision to extend trade talks between Britain and the European Union kept hopes of an eventual deal alive, but gains in London's blue-chips were limited by a higher pound and a 6.2% drop in AstraZeneca. With banks in the lead, Europe's benchmark STOXX 600 index rose 0.7% after breaking a five-week winning streak to end 1% lower last week.


Tech View: Third Doji in a row on Nifty is bad omenNifty50 on Monday formed a ‘Doji’ candle on the daily chart, the third in a row. The formation of such an indecisive candle at highs suggests the momentum is weakening, even as the buying momentum continues at lows. A close observation of the last 14 sessions suggests Nifty50 has chalked out an ascending channel with a narrow trading range, and the bulls have in the past five sessions worked hard, if not struggled, to get past the upper boundary of the said channel, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

 None of the Indian cement companies responded to Reuters requests for a comment.

 The CCI did not respond to a request for comment. 

 The CCI does not make any details of ongoing cartel cases or raids public. 

 India is the second largest cement producer in the world and accounted for more than 8% of global installed capacity in 2019, figures from the India Brand Equity Foundation show. Cement sales in India stood at $9 billion in 2019-20. 

 India's commerce minister Piyush Goyal last year told parliament the CCI was examining complaints of cartelisation by cement companies.

 Given the impact on industry of COVID-19, the latest raids could add to the pressure, Rudresh Singh, an antitrust partner at India's L&L Partners, said. 

 ""There is already significant stress in the sector due to the pandemic,"" Singh said.

 In 2012, the CCI imposed a total penalty of $1.1 billion on several cement companies for colluding to under-use their plants and create an artificial shortage of cement. An appeal against that decision is still pending. 

 In recent years, the CCI has raided offices of other foreign companies, including beer giant Carlsberg and commodities trader Glencore on allegations of price collusion in their industry."

It’s a risk they’re willing to take.

A star-studded cast of global banks and fund houses have increased their presence in China this year and a record $212 billion of foreign funds have poured into Chinese bonds and stocks. Alongside have come a myriad of measures from Washington aimed at decoupling the US from China, an issue that’s drawn bipartisan support given widespread alarm about the Asian nation’s rising influence in global affairs.

The latest US salvo was fired on Wednesday with the passage of legislation that could lead to Chinese companies -- including behemoths like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. -- getting kicked off American exchanges. The turbulence hasn’t swayed global finance from the opportunity to capture a share of profits that are estimated to swell to $47 billion in investment banking alone by 2026.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are now pushing to take full control of their China ventures, while fund giants such as BlackRock Inc have been given the greenlight to set up shop.

“There’s a lot of risk and uncertainty about future policy directions” said Chen Zhiwu, director of the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong. “But on the other hand, wow, the market is so big so some people are still willing to go in for the potential high gain at the cost of being exposed to a lot of high risk.”

All signs point to Congress continuing the confrontation under President-elect Joe Biden’s administration, with the risk of the finance industry becoming deeper enmeshed. Biden’s pick for national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, has questioned why the US should prioritize opening China for the likes of Goldman Sachs, arguing that the competition between the two powers will turn on how “effectively each country stewards its national economy and shapes the global economy.”

At the same time, Beijing has vowed to continue easing barriers to its capital markets. Guo Shuqing, the chairman of the China Banking & Insurance Regulator Commission, wrote in a recent article that the fortunes of a nation are “often closely tied to its financial power” and that it will seek to actively participate in shaping international rules.

The opening isn’t some act to “reconcile” with the US to defuse tensions but driven by self interest, said Jessie Guo, head of equity research at China Merchants Securities HK Co. The nation will keep the doors open as it pivots toward a “dual circulation” strategy in which the domestic market becomes the main growth driver, supplemented by foreign demand, she said.


Bloomberg

The push has so far paid off for China in a tumultuous year, when its economy outperformed major rivals after the nation successfully contained the coronavirus.

A September survey by HSBC Qianhai Securities showed that almost two-thirds of more than 900 global institutional investors and major corporations are planning to increase their investment in China by an average of 25% over the next year. Investors in North America stood out as the only ones saying they will hold off on increasing their exposure to mainland Chinese corporate bonds and commercial paper.

Approvals to take major control in China have continued for foreign banks, asset managers and payment clearing networks. Firms including Goldman and Credit Suisse Group AG have ambitious hiring plans in China, and argue they can boost investments in the country since they are better able to control where the money is being put to use. Analysts at Goldman at the end of last year estimated profits in the Chinese brokerage sector could reach $47 billion by 2026, up from $10 billion in 2018.

Regulators have also given overseas traders access to futures and options, expanded a US-style registration system for IPOs and scrapped quotas on foreign inflows.

That’s being noticed in the halls of Washington. A Congressional commission this week warned that China’s financial opening was part of a “calculated strategy” to secure foreign investments and use them to shore up the domestic economy.

US lawmakers this week approved legislation that could lead to Chinese companies getting delisted unless they allow a review of their financial audits, albeit with a three-year phase-in period. Sanctions on Chinese firms connected to the military triggered JPMorgan to exclude new bonds from impacted companies from its widely followed debt indexes, underscoring how the US can affect index-tracking investors around the world.

Banks also face a deadline this month for ensuring that they aren’t doing business with Hong Kong and Chinese officials sanctioned over their role in the political crackdown on the financial hub. Lenders, including major Chinese banks, have already taken steps to comply.


What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:

Decoupling from the US could create a windfall for China’s financial sector as it swoops in for a bigger slice of the global IPO market, drawing overseas investors to its derivatives trading and adding new vigor to the world’s fastest-growing pool of wealth. Yet, worsening relations with the US could spook foreign companies enough for them to consider postponing expansion, cutting investment, or leaving China altogether. Read more here

Banks and asset managers have to do more due diligence to avoid the risks of servicing sanctioned Chinese firms such as helping them to list or to raise capital, according to Benjamin Quinlan, chief executive officer at Quinlan & Associates, a strategy consultant in Hong Kong.

“That means having much stricter ‘know your customer’ and onboarding controls,” he said. “The reality is the biggest fines in the world are for sanction breaches with the US”

China’s response so far has been to continue down the path of further opening, though the toughest reforms are yet to come. China’s strategy to make the yuan a global currency has so far come up short, with its share in payments falling to 1.66% as of October from 1.94% at the end of last year.

Capital controls and the uncertainty of repatriating funds remain a key hurdle for global investors as do a lack of transparency in rule-making. The abrupt cancellation of Ant Group’s record IPO in early November sent shudders through the markets.

That hasn’t swayed global firms such as Goldman Sachs. President John Waldron said in October that the US bank is still waiting on further guidance on how to apply for a 100% stake. He also proposed further liberalization measures including reduced constraints on outbound capital flows, allowing foreign firms to act as market makers in China’s bond connect and further alignment with international regulatory standards.

Henry Fernandez, chairman of MSCI Inc., said in a recent Bloomberg TV interview that the opening shows China “is recognizing that in order to have that leadership in the world, economically, politically and financially, they need to embrace openness and become one of the largest countries in the world in all these markets.”

With the incoming Biden administration, “hopefully we can avoid a capital war, which can be devastating,” Fernandez said."
Larsen & Toubro,"Dec 03, 2020, 08:23 PM IST",RBI likely to hold rates amid inflation: Things to watch out for,"By Anirban Nag

India’s central bank will likely keep interest rates unchanged for a third straight meeting as inflation stays stubbornly high and signs appear of growth beginning to return to Asia’s third-largest economy.

The six-member Monetary Policy Committee is forecast to hold the benchmark repurchase rate at 4% Friday, according to all 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg as of Thursday. A spike in consumer prices forced the panel to pause after cutting rates by 115 basis points this year, although it’s expected to conserve some ammunition to support growth by retaining an accommodative stance for the near future.

“The RBI will be well served by not making changes to the repo rate or its accommodative stance,” said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in Mumbai. She expects the central bank to update its forecasts on inflation and growth, besides sharing its views on developments including a liquidity glut in the money market.

What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“It will probably stick to its forward guidance for an accommodative stance through March 2021 and into next fiscal year.”
-- Abhishek Gupta, India economist

Here’s what to watch for in the MPC decision to be announced by Governor Shaktikanta Das at 10 a.m. in Mumbai Friday. He will hold a virtual briefing two hours later:


Growth Outlook
The central bank, which expects the economy to shrink 9.5% in the year to March, may revise its forecast after a less-than-expected decline in gross domestic product in the July-September quarter. For now, the economy is in a technical recession, and the RBI’s previous forecast was for a 5.6% contraction in the quarter through December, followed by a return to growth in the three months to March.


Bloomberg
A separate Bloomberg survey of the December quarter showed economists were less gloomy, with the median forecast for a 2% contraction. For the full year, they expect an 8.7% decline, which is a tad milder than their previous prediction for an 8.9% drop.

High-frequency indicators suggest activity picked up in October due to festival demand and inventory drawdown. While some of those positives spilled over to November, there are signs that demand is tapering off. Data on Thursday showed activity in India’s dominant services sector cooled a tad last month, with the purchasing managers’ index falling to 53.7 from 54.1 a month ago. The composite index declined to 56.3 from 58, IHS Markit said.


Inflation Forecast
Headline retail inflation of well above 7% is the bugbear for monetary policy makers, given that they have a mandate of keeping it between 2%-6%. Late last month, RBI Executive Director and MPC member Mridul Saggar said more policy space will be created only when inflation eases, with the central bank having cut rates by a “great deal.”

“Inflation spiked to 7.6% in October on rising food prices, making the MPC’s 5.4%-4.5% forecast for second half of the fiscal year difficult to achieve,” said Kanika Pasricha, an economist at Standard Chartered Plc in Mumbai. “The MPC may sound cautious on inflation.”


Bloomberg
Economists at Nomura Holdings Inc. dropped their call for 50 basis-points of rate cuts in the first half of 2021, given the upside to inflation, while Kaushik Das, chief India economist at Deutsche Bank AG, sees no further room for easing in this cycle.


Yield Management
Given its hands are tied by high inflation, the central bank has opted to keep borrowing costs in check by conducting open market bond purchases, liquidity injections and its own version of “Operation Twist” where it sells short-dated securities and buys the long-term ones in a bid to ensure that the yield curve does not steepen.

The resultant glut of liquidity in the banking system has led to a crash in short-term rates, raising questions about the efficacy of the rate. As such, the RBI’s yield curve and liquidity management will be in focus Friday.

The MPC’s views on liquidity will assume more importance, as the transient surplus has pushed down short-term rates sharply, said Radhika Rao, an economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore."

The divestment is a part of L&T’s strategy to exit non-core businesses and consolidate operations. 

Rolls-Royce said the acquisition will significantly expand the ship automation division of its MTU product and solution brand of its power systems business. 

The companies have not disclosed the deal size.

L&T’s wholly owned subsidiary Larsen & Toubro International FZE runs Servowatch Systems that is headquartered in Heybridge, Essex. The unit has 44 employees in the UK and India who work on integrated marine automation solutions for navies, commercial vessels and large yachts. 

“The divestment of Servowatch Systems is as per our stated goal of unlocking value within the existing business portfolio by divesting non-core units,” S N Subrahmanyan, CEO and MD of Larsen & Toubro, said in a statement. “L&T facilitated the business to develop an award-winning software platform for the latest generation of marine integrated platform management systems that are sold globally to many navies and commercial operators. We believe its partnership with Rolls-Royce and its product and solution brand MTU will pave the way for its further growth.” 

Andreas Schell, CEO of Rolls-Royce Power Systems, said, “Servowatch's modern and sophisticated range of automation and integrated bridge systems for government and commercial ships and large yachts is the ideal complement to continue to offer sophisticated total system solutions for marine propulsion systems and the entire ship automation sector.”

L&T continuously evaluates its business portfolio with a long-term perspective for capital allocation. Earlier this year, it closed a Rs 14,000-crore deal to sell its electric and automation business to French firm Schneider Electric. 

In the past, it has divested its stake in ports, insurance and road concessions businesses, while exiting some others like petrol pump vending machines and cement businesses."

Bitcoin’s recovery from a rout last week is stoking speculation that the cryptocurrency can breach $20,000 for the first time.

The digital asset is trading near the all-time high of $19,857.03 set on Monday, after jumping 15 per cent since one of its worst one-day drops this year on Nov. 26.

“We should surpass $20,000 this week, targets being anywhere around $20,000-$25,000,” said Vijay Ayyar, head of business development with crypto exchange Luno in Singapore. But after that he expects a 30 per cent drop since Bitcoin tends to “get everyone bullish and then dump,” he said.

Bitcoin’s proponents argue a widening investor base shows the largest cryptocurrency is coming of age. Critics say this year’s 170 per cent rally is a bubble despite claims that digital assets are increasingly being used to diversify portfolios and taking some flows away from gold.

BloombergBitcoin was trading at about $19,410 as of 3:40 p.m. in Tokyo. The broader Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which has more than tripled this year, was little changed.

The surge in Bitcoin to a record this week “is likely a result of major institutional investors joining the bandwagon and purchasing a portion of BTC’s limited supply in the midst of a bull run,” said Gunnar Jaerv, chief operating officer of Hong Kong-based custodian First Digital Trust.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists said in a Nov. 27 note that investments into and out of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust -- a fund that invests in and tracks the price of the digital asset -- is among the keys to the price outlook.

If flows into the trust wane, Bitcoin could suffer should commodity trading advisors and other quantitative funds again unwind long Bitcoin futures positions as likely happened in last week’s slump, according to the strategists."
Larsen & Toubro,"Dec 01, 2020, 03:32 PM IST",Zoom’s revenue forecast tops estimates amid 2021 concerns,"By Nico Grant

Zoom Video Communications Inc. gave a revenue forecast for the current quarter that topped analysts’ estimates but suggested a slight decline in its explosive growth, touching off concerns among investors that the software maker’s pandemic boom may be coming to an end. Shares declined about 5% in extended trading.

Revenue will be as much as $811 million in the period that ends in January, the San Jose, California-based company said Monday in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected $719 million. The company’s sales guidance, at the high end, estimates a 330% increase from a year earlier -- a slight decline in the year-over-year growth from the previous two quarters.

Zoom’s projected slowing revenue expansion in the current period highlights investors’ concerns that 2021 won’t be as favorable for the software maker as this year, when the company gained customers forced to work and go to school remotely. Zoom’s stock has jumped sevenfold thus far in 2020, heightening questions about whether the company is overvalued. Wall Street has fawned over the company for its accelerating sales growth, but analysts have raised questions about how long it might last.

Investors also may be disappointed by cost issues. The company reported adjusted gross margin of 68.2% in the fiscal third quarter, compared with 82.9% in the same period a year earlier and 72.3% in previous period. Analysts had expected 71.8%. Zoom said the margin decline was due to expenses associated with public cloud services and supporting non-paying users. Executives said investors should expect similar numbers into the next fiscal year before the gross margin starts to improve.

Zoom said sales increased 367% to $777.2 million in the quarter, which ended Oct. 31. Profit, excluding some items, was 99 cents a share. Analysts projected revenue of $693.4 million and adjusted profit of 75 cents.

Zoom’s stock has become a barometer of the pandemic economy, rising when Covid-19 lockdowns emerge and falling on good news about vaccines. Chief Executive Officer Eric Yuan has tried to diversify Zoom’s capabilities for large enterprises, small- and mid-sized businesses and individuals so the company can grow after the coronavirus is controlled and greater numbers of workers return to their offices. The software maker in October announced OnZoom, a platform for hosting paid classes, lessons and charity events. It also debuted Zoom Apps, a way to more tightly integrate Zoom with other applications used during video conferences.

Zoom named Amazon Web Services its preferred cloud provider, the Amazon.com Inc. unit said in a statement after Zoom’s results. The companies have been partners since 2011, but Zoom has recently begun using Oracle Corp.’s cloud as well. Separately, Zoom said that it would spend more on capital expenditures in the current period to boost its own data center capacity. Such a move could pare back the company’s reliance on cloud services.

Zoom said it had 433,700 customers with more than 10 employees at the end of the quarter and 1,289 contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12-month revenue. Both figures topped analysts’ average estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

“We remain focused on the communication needs of our customers and communities as they navigate the current environment and adapt to a new world of work from anywhere using Zoom,” Yuan said in the statement."

Bitcoin clawed back all of its losses from the biggest rout since March, showing a resiliency in a cryptocurrency rally that’s outperformed most major asset classes in 2020.

The most-traded digital coin rose over the weekend and added almost 5% more on Monday to $19,109. That topped its peak closing level reached last week, before prices started tumbling. A Bloomberg gauge of the biggest cryptocurrencies is up 13% from Friday.


Bloomberg

“The Bitcoin correction didn’t last long,” according to Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, who said the token may be poised for a new high. Entering “uncharted territory and the psychological boost that would come with a move like this could propel Bitcoin aggressively higher.” He is targeting $20,000 in the short term.

Bitcoin’s volatility was on show last week, when it crashed by more than $3,000 in just two days. The plunge triggered massive volume in spot and futures trading and drew particular attention because it began just hours after the currency failed to set a new intraday record. Strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. said that while the recent tumble cleared some speculative “froth,” further declines remain possible.

The futures market is proving that it’s becoming a more important risk-hedging venue for Bitcoin. Open interest on the CME Group platform has averaged 8,300 contracts in 2020 versus 4,000 last year.

Recouping sharp losses is not unusual for Bitcoin. The last time it dove 10% in one day, May 10, it took just four days to recover.

Bitcoin’s more-than-150% rally this year coincides with a steady flow of investments by institutions into the coin and into crypto infrastructure, from trading systems to custody. The latest was from Guggenheim Partners LLC, which said in a filing Friday it might invest up to 10% of its $5.3 billion Macro Opportunities Fund in a Bitcoin trust."
Larsen & Toubro,"Nov 28, 2020, 11:05 AM IST",Bitcoin extends decline after biggest slump since pandemic hit,"By Adam Haigh and Todd White

Bitcoin and many of its major peers slumped on Friday in the wake of some of the biggest declines since the onset of the pandemic, a selloff that has stirred fresh doubt about this year’s craze for cryptocurrencies. The most-traded digital coin slid 3.1% to $16,522.61 at 11:05 a.m. in New York. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index extended a two-day plunge to about 19% -- its biggest since mid-March. The rout was kicked off by worries over the prospect of tighter crypto rules in the U.S. and profit-taking after a big rally, investors said. Even with the slump, Bitcoin has more than doubled this year -- an advance that has split opinion.

Crypto believers tout a broadening investor base and the search for a hedge against dollar weakness as reasons for a durable boom. Critics point to a history of big swings, including a spectacular boom and bust three years ago.


Bloomberg

“We will see some choppy water in the short term as the market finds new levels before attempting another assault on the all-time high” said crypto analyst Jason Dean at Quantum Economics. “The pullback so far would not concern experienced Bitcoin traders or holders to any significant degree.”

Proponents of digital assets say the current focus on cryptocurrencies compared with 2017 is different because of growing institutional interest, for instance from the likes of Fidelity Investments and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Just this week, Van Eck Associates Corp. launched a Bitcoin exchange-traded note on the Deutsche Boerse Xetra exchange. In October, PayPal Holdings Inc. said it would allow customers access to cryptocurrencies.


FOMO
“After big rallies in shares and various other assets, they are all vulnerable to a bit of a pause,” said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney. “Bitcoin more than most, as it surged higher far more and had become far more frothy with speculative interest.”

Others see signs of retail investors piling in to chase momentum for fast gains, storing up an inevitable reckoning. The rout in Bitcoin began just hours after it rose to within $7 of its record high of $19,511 set in December 2017.


Bloomberg

Profit-taking was inevitable and there are still factors in favor of Bitcoin as an asset class, according to Byron Goldberg in Sydney, who runs the Australian operations for Luno, the cryptocurrency exchange and trading platform.

“It continues to attract both institutional and retail attention as a 21st-century substitute to the gold play,” he said.


Crypto ‘Whales’A few large holders often referred to as whales own most Bitcoin. About 2% of the anonymous ownership accounts that can be tracked on the cryptocurrency’s blockchain control 95% of the digital asset, according to researcher Flipside Crypto. That structure points to the risk of big price swings if major investors offload some of their stakes.

“Bitcoin may be a victim of its own success,” said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets Plc in Sydney. “Traders suggested several large holders moved to lock in gains as the cryptocurrency reached for all-time highs.”

AMP Capital’s Oliver said the depth of the recent plunge shows Bitcoin is “hardly a secure store of value,” adding it may be vulnerable if Covid-19 vaccines lead to a sharp global recovery next year.

“Money printing and the debasement of paper currencies that Bitcoin enthusiasts are seeking to protect against may start to fade as an issue,” Oliver said."

A recent tussle between a hedge fund and Indian mining giant Vedanta Ltd. is spotlighting growing scrutiny of a unit based in the British crown dependency of Jersey.

That entity is Cairn India Holdings Ltd. (CIHL). Vedanta’s shareholder, hedge fund Kyma Capital, said earlier this month that a $956 million loan from Vedanta Ltd. to its holding company Vedanta Resources Ltd. -- channeled through CIHL -- represented an “improper transfer of value.”

Since then, Vedanta Resources’s dollar bonds have declined. The company’s $670 million of notes due June 2021 slumped as much as 7.7 cents Thursday. The drop came after people familiar with the matter said the firm had begun sounding out debt holders about the possibility of extending maturities on some of its dollar securities to reduce refinancing pressures. The Vedanta group denies talks with any bondholder for an extension.


Bloomberg


What is Cairn India Holdings Ltd.
It’s an offshore subsidiary in Jersey, an island near the coast of France in the English Channel. Established in 2006, CIHL was a holding vehicle owned by Cairn India Ltd., when the firm was held by Cairn Energy Plc, before Vedanta Resources acquired a controlling stake in 2011. Later, London-based Vedanta Resources merged Cairn with its India unit Vedanta Ltd. in 2017. It’s now a unit of Vedanta Ltd., and owns a stake in its key oil field in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan.

CIHL is audited by an Indian firm based in a suburban business district of India’s capital region: VD & Co. The audit firm, which has 20 people and was founded in 2010, lists two partners, according to its website.

CIHL serves an important role in financing tycoon Anil Agarwal’s complex holding structure. CIHL has acted as a bridge between the cash-spinning India assets, including Mumbai-listed Vedanta Ltd., and debt-heavy London-based holding vehicles.


Why is scrutiny of CIHL rising now
Earlier this month, London-based Kyma Capital said that Vedanta Ltd. siphoned off funds belonging to stakeholders through the CIHL facility.

Kyma on Nov. 11 also flagged corporate governance concerns about the resignation of an independent director from Vedanta Ltd., and a change in auditors of CIHL from Ernst & Young LLP to the lesser-known Indian accounting firm. VD & Co. Managing Partner Vaibhaw Kedia declined to comment.

Separately, EY stepped down as auditor of Vedanta Resources earlier this year and confirmed “there are no circumstances connected with its resignation which it considers should be brought to the attention of the members or creditors of the company,” Vedanta Resources said in an exchange filing Nov. 20.

A Vedanta spokesman declined to comment on CIHL and the Kyma allegations. The unsecured loans were extended mainly as cash management activities for better rates, Vedanta Chief Financial Officer Arun Kumar said in a call with analysts Nov. 6.


CIHL’s financial position
CIHL held cash and short-term investments worth about $780 million as of March 2020, more than half of which came from the unwinding of a transaction in 2019 that drew shareholder ire and a slew of analyst downgrades.

Agarwal used CIHL as a vehicle to house his economic interest in Anglo American Plc, originally bought by one of his London holding vehicles named Volcan Investments Ltd. The transaction was unwound in July 2019, earlier than scheduled.

CIHL received $397.7 million in the financial year ended March 2020 from the unwinding, according to financial disclosures. Vedanta said the encashment reflects its “disciplined approach to treasury management and capital allocation.”


What’s the broader backdrop
The tussle between Kyma Capital and Vedanta comes at a key time for billionaire Agarwal.

Vedanta Ltd. holding companies Vedanta Resources Ltd. and Volcan Investments Cyprus Ltd. must repay a combined $1.17 billion next year. That’s the most since 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Twin Star Holdings Ltd., the Mauritius-based unit of Vedanta Resources that received loans from CIHL, has $414 million of bank loans coming due in December and $112.5 million maturing in February 2021, according to a bond prospectus published in August.

Vedanta Resources in August said it was in breach of a financial covenant as on March 31 for which it secured waivers, but added it could need more relaxations in coming months.


What else
CIHL has also been used as a vehicle for acquisitions outside its core commodity business in the past. In December 2017, CIHL spent $158 million to acquire the debt and controlling interest in AvanStrate Inc, a Japanese LCD glass substrate maker."

Larsen & Toubro,"Nov 27, 2020, 01:08 PM IST",Nifty firms belie doomsayers’ estimates to report best-ever profits for Q2,"NEW DELHI: In April, when all projections foresaw doom for Indian businesses in the coming quarters and estimated a severe impact on the economy from the lockdown, if someone had told you Nifty firms would log record profit in the September quarter, you would have probably laughed at it!

But this is exactly what happened. An analysis by Motilal Oswal showed Nifty50 companies reported highest-ever cumulative profit after tax at Rs 1,04,200 crore, eclipsing the previous record set in the March quarter of 2019.

Cost reduction, better-than-expected demand recovery and lower provisions for financial firms are some of the things that helped boost the bottom line, said Gautam Duggad, Head of Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

RIL, HDFC Bank and TCS make the biggest contributions to this number accounting for one-quarter of total profit at Rs 25,700 crore. Three companies reported net losses: M&M, Tata Motors and L&T, data compiled from the Ace Equity database showed.

“The September quarter numbers were fantastic and better than our expectations across sectors, especially for auto, IT, pharma, FMCG and chemicals,” said Rahul Sharma, Market Strategist & Research Head, Equity99 Advisors.

He said the government steps to lift consumer sentiment and companies’ focus on making most of the opportunity were the biggest reasons behind this outperformance during the September quarter after a really depressing June quarter as far as earnings are concerned.

Thanks to these superior performances, Nifty is at an all-time high now. On Tuesday, it moved past the 13,000 mark for the first time and is up over 70 per cent from March lows.

But can businesses replicate their September quarter financial performance in the coming quarters? Analysts are hopeful, but some degree of caution.

“It is very tough to predict. Our expectations are for 10 per cent EPS growth for the whole of FY21,” Duggad said, adding that the cumulative profits recorded by the companies that Motilal tracks also was the highest ever for the July-September period.

Sharma said expectations for December quarter are very high, as it is the best period in terms of earnings opportunity. He believes IT and pharma are again likely to outperform this season as well as auto, including the commercial side.

However, he said a second wave of Covid infections and subsequent lockdown could emerge as major risk factors.

“If a lockdown is re-imposed in major states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat during the December quarter, this will affect industrial outlook, as these are the states where most of the industrial plants are situated,” Sharma said."

Larsen & Toubro,"Nov 27, 2020, 12:24 PM IST","5 MFs that make the most of bull runs, cushion downside","Investors confused about the direction of the stock market in the wake of its record-breaking run could consider balanced advantage funds, which invest in a mix of debt and equity. These funds allocate less to equities when market valuations appear expensive, and vice versa. The equity component varies from 30% to 70-80% depending on market conditions. 

“Markets shall remain volatile given where we stand today in terms of valuations, the overall economic environment prevailing due to Covid-19, very low interest rates across the globe and the backdrop of one of the best bull rallies we have witnessed since 2009 which is liquidity driven,” said Sankaran Naren, Chief Investment Officer, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund. He believes it is apt to make lump sum investments in such products now. 

These funds enable investors to do away with timing the markets as this strategy has built-in profit booking at higher equity valuations. ET takes a look at five dynamic asset allocation funds based on recommendations by financial advisors:


Edelweiss Balanced Advantage FundAssets under management: Rs 1,692 crore
Fund Manager: Bharat Lahoti/ Bhavesh Jain / Gautam Kaul Top 3 equity holding: HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Infosys
3-year/5-year return (%): 10.40/10.57

The fund manager follows a procyclical approach where he maintains higher equity levels to create wealth if markets continue to rise and lowers equity levels to protect the downside when markets fall. Net equity allocation is maintained between 30-80% with rebalancing done daily. Above 70-80% of the equity portfolio is allocated to large-caps with the balance to midcaps. Debt portion is managed conservatively with the portfolio at the short end not taking any duration calls and allocation to only AAA-rated paper.


DSP Dynamic Asset Allocation FundAssets under management: Rs 1,747 crore
Fund Manager: Atul Bhole and Saurabh Bhatia
Top 3 equity holding: HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Infosys
3-year/5-year return (%): 9.23/ 9.82

The fund managers use a two-factor asset allocation model which is a mix of fundamentals as well as technicals and could have equity allocation between 20-90%. While fundamental factors like PE, PB ratio decide the core equity allocation, technical signals capitalise on upswings to capture core equity allocation. This model participates in bull phases and limits downside during bear phases. The focus is on buying quality businesses, staying invested and using market corrections to average down costs.


ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage FundAssets under management: Rs 26,123 crore
Fund Manager: Ihab Dalwai/ Manish Banthia / Rajat Chandak / Sankaran Naren
Top 3 equity holding: Reliance, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank
3-year/5-year return (%): 8.28/ 10.49

The largest fund by assets under management in this category, the scheme adjusts its equity allocation based on the price-to-book-value ratio of the market, with rebalancing done daily. Given the sharp rise in the markets, the current equity allocation is at 58.5 %. The fund’s equity exposure can range anywhere between 30% and 80%, with debt making up the rest. The equity portion is mainly invested in large cap stocks while the debt portfolio is actively managed with the fund manager taking both duration calls as well as investing in below AAA-rated paper to earn higher accruals.


IDFC Dynamic Equity FundAssets under management: Rs 1,088 crore
Fund Manager: Arpit Kapoor, Sumit Agrawal and Arvind Subramanian
Top 3 equity holding: Infosys, Reliance, ICICI Bank
3-year/5-year return (%): 8.22 /9.34

This fund also follows the ‘buy low sell high’ model and makes its equity allocation based on the trailing P/E of Nifty 50 index with a minimum 30% and maximum 100%. The equity component is actively managed and the fund manager combines quality stocks with good growth potential. The debt component is actively managed to focus on a short to moderate duration strategy.


L&T Balanced Advantage FundAssets under management: Rs 851 crore
Fund Manager: Vihang Naik/ Praveen Ayathan / Venugopal Manghat / Jalpan Shah
Top 3 equity holding: Reliance, ICICI Bank, Bharti Airtel
3-year/5-year return (%): 8.43 /8.20

The fund managers follow the ‘buy low sell high’ philosophy to decide allocation between equity and debt depending on the prevailing market and economic conditions. Some of the metrics considered for deciding the debt-equity mix at any point in time could be the interest rate cycle and equity valuations. The debt component is conservatively managed with AAA-rated holdings and low duration risk.

According to several people in the know, the standalone Indian company floated the VRS scheme on Friday specifying an eligibility criteria for employees who have been with the company for a period of five years and above.

The compensation extended to the employees is a combination of age and number of years served by the employee with a multiplier, say people in the know.

Tata Motors,"Dec 08, 2020, 11:04 AM IST","Korean Kia, China-owned MG Motor crack Indian market with SUVs","(This story originally appeared in  on Dec 08, 2020)CHENNAI: Are the new SUV warriors Kia and MG disrupting the pecking order in Motown? October and November festival sales have changed the rankings in the passenger vehicle (PV) industry. While the top two — Maruti and Hyundai — remain the same, Tata Motors is back at No.3 and Kia is at No.4, and Mahindra & Mahindra is at No.5. The bottom 5 are Renault, Honda, Toyota, MG and Ford, thus introducing two newcomers Kia and MG into the top 10.

The entry of Kia and MG shows that it is possible to crack the Indian market without a single sedan or compact car in the portfolio. Take Kia, which got into the top-5 PV ranking within months of its launch. After the rollout in the last week of August 2019, it entered the top-4 list last in January 2020 with 15,450 units of sales. It became the No.3 PV company with 15,644 and 8,583 units of sales in February and March. 

But it is in October and November that Kia hit an all-time high of 21,021 and 21,022 units respectively, earning the South Korean auto company a firm position in the top-5 PV pecking order. Kia sold a total of 88,610 units in April-November this year.




“Kia Motors entered the Indian market and became the 4th highest selling manufacturer in the first month itself and has had an uninterrupted position among the top-5 carmakers in India over the last six months. With nearly 1,74,000 units cumulatively sold since August 2019, and consistent market leadership position in both mid-SUV and compact SUV segments, it’s the outcome of giving Indian customers aspirational lifestyle products,” said Kia Motors India executive director & chief sales officer Tae-Jin Park.

Ditto for MG, which is focusing only on premium SUVs to begin with. “We only have plans for SUVs in phase-1 of operations. Our strategy has been to focus on technology, diversity and good experience of dealers and customers. We are not aiming for volumes. We want to fill the Halol plant production in phase-1, which has approximately 80,000-1,00,000 units capacity and would require overall Rs 4,000 crore of investment in India, out of which Rs 3,000 crore has already been invested. We should reach that peak capacity by 2022,” said MG Motor India president & MD Rajeev Chaba.

MG Motor sold 18,128 units in the April-November 2020 period, including 4,163 units in November. According to auto expert Hormazd Sorabjee, the success of Kia and MG shows that “you don’t need to be in the budget car market” to be a hit. The reason why these brands cracked the market, he added, is because of the style and feature loads their products come with.

“Tech features, gizmos and gadgets, good styling, a modern look and feel and the right price — that’s the combo,” he said. What has also helped Kia is the success of fellow Korean brand and sister company Hyundai. “Hyundai’s success in India has definitely helped Kia,” said Sorabjee. The Kia Seltos shares the same architecture as the Hyundai Creta, and the Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue share the same platform."
Tata Motors,"Dec 07, 2020, 11:55 PM IST","Commercial vehicle sales picking up, likely to regain peak, says VE Commercial Vehicles MD","NEW DELHI: Demand for commercial vehicles – a key indicator of economic activity – has started picking up and the industry is expected to get back on to the growth path in the next financial year, Vinod Aggarwal, managing director of VE Commercial Vehicles, told ET. 

Sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles in the country have declined 58% year on year between April and November, he said. 

“However, demand has improved over the past two months as the trucking industry is picking up,” Aggarwal said. “Going forward, with economic activity expected to better, sentiments are positive. With the possibility of (Covid-19) vaccine, the next financial year should bode much better for industry.”

Replacement demand for medium and heavy commercial vehicles, which had petered out the last three years, is expected to gain pace as economic activity increases and support growth in the segment. 

VE Commercial Vehicles, a joint venture between Volvo Group and Eicher Motors, is a small but significant player with about 5% share in the Indian commercial vehicle market, behind market leader Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra and Ashok Leyland.

While overall, sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles are still likely to decline by 40% in 2020-21, the industry is expected to grow thereafter and regain peak sales of 390,732 units registered in FY19 next fiscal year. 

Sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles had dropped by 42.47% to 224,806 units last fiscal.

Aggarwal said the excess capacity which had been released in the marked on account of a change in axle load norms has been absorbed. And, even though cost of acquisition of commercial vehicles have increased due to the implementation of BSVI emission norms, new trucks deliver higher productivity, and have lower overall cost of ownership, which would make them attractive for buyers, he said. 

VE Commercial Vehicles has invested Rs 350 crore in commissioning a new plant in Bhopal on Saturday to cash in on demand once the market revives. The company has earmarked an additional Rs 150 crore to set up a paint shop at the facility. The new unit will take the company’s total investment in Madhya Pradesh to over Rs 5,000 crore.

“Together with our facilities in Pithampur, we will now have the capacity to produce 130,000 units per annum,” Aggarwal said. “This puts us in a very good position because once the market improves, we will be able to take advantage of this investment and cash in on demand.”

The new manufacturing unit has initial installed capacity to roll out 40,000 units per annum.

With the commissioning of the new facility, Aggarwal said the company is at the close of an investment cycle. It will continue to invest Rs 300-400 crore every year as capex going forward, he said."

Tata Motors,"Dec 03, 2020, 11:40 PM IST","Tata Motors looks to strengthen EV leadership, gives larger role to ex-Nissan EV expert Mitsuhiko Yamashita","MUMBAI: Tata Motors has enhanced the position of Mitsuhiko Yamashita in less than a month after roping in the former Nissan electric vehicle expert, in a sign that it’s looking to further strengthen its leadership position in the nascent EV market in India.

While the auto major had announced the appointment of Yamashita as an independent director in October, in early November it named him as a non-independent director on the company board.

Experts said the move is aimed at giving Yamashita a larger role in the company considering his vast experience in the EV space, an area Tata Motors is increasing its focus on. 

Tata Motors can tap into Yamashita’s experience in setting up an EV supply chain for Nissan.




Yamashita has more than 40 years of experience in developing electric vehicles, autonomous drive and various other technologies to support Nissan Motor Company’s goal of achieving zero fatalities and zero emissions. 

He has joined the board of Tata Motors for a five-year period. He is expected to bring his expertise to Tata Motors and Jaguar Land Rover as both companies fast track their electric vehicle plans.

“As a non-executive and non-independent director, Mitsuhiko Yamashita will be advising Tata Motors Group on engineering, quality and electrification,” a company spokesperson said.

Tata Motors believes EVs can corner up to 12% of new car sales in India as early as 2022.

It has sold more than 2,000 Nexon EVs in India so far, within a year of its commercial launch, the company said on Thursday.

Acknowledged as the most preferred electric car in India, Nexon EV is the best seller in its segment, helping Tata Motors post a market share of 70% in EVs in the first quarter of this fiscal.

At present, fleet segment is driving the sales for EVs. “We think that personal EV segments can be as high as the fleet segment,” a company official said.

To strengthen its passenger vehicle business, Tata Motors recently brought in Rajan Amba laterally as vice president, sales and marketing, passenger vehicles business unit, reporting to Shailesh Chandra, president and CEO, passenger vehicle business unit. 

Amba was earlier chief operating officer of Carat Lane, a subsidiary company of Titan.

Automakers across the globe such as Ford, Toyota, Suzuki, Volkswagen, Daimler, Audi, and BMW are collaborating to reduce development costs for the next generation of vehicles. 

A partnership with VW was called off by Tata Motors in 2018, but sources said the carmakers still have an open mind on a possible tie-up with the Indian automaker.

Such a collaboration can help accelerate their growth plan and offset huge investments even as they adopt newer technologies and shorten product lifecycles.

Earlier this year, Tata Motors had announced an intent to subsidiarise its passenger vehicle business as the first step towards securing mutually beneficial strategic alliances that provide access to products, architectures, power trains, new-age technologies and capital. 

It was engaged in a discussion with its Chinese firm Chery Automobile, but because of the border tension, those discussions for Indian market have been put to rest.

The company maintained that the whole purpose of subsidiarisation is “to actively look for a partner because this is a reality for all of us that a collaboration can unleash a bigger potential in the next decade which is going to see significant investments in new technologies and regulations”."

 Offering connected drive experience with zero emissions and at an attractive pricing, the Nexon EV has found widespread acceptance among its customers, he added.

Tata Motors,"Dec 01, 2020, 08:05 AM IST",Tata Motors is making all the right turns in FY21,"Mumbai: Tata Motors is connecting its aspirational dots – and that’s quickly clearing the fog on the windshield. In a crowded local market, it is beginning to pull ahead of rivals, and seeking to ride burgeoning demand for personal mobility to build a bold presence in a voluminous segment where it has always been an also-ran - the hatchback.

Let’s start with the local sales data. In what’s turning out to be the proverbial annus horribilis for every other industry barring remote connectivity, Tata Motors appears to be slowly moving into top gear. India’s auto industry shrank by a fifth, but the maker of Tiago and Nexon has logged 15% growth already in FY-21. Nexon and Harrier are at the vanguard of the expansion in market size, and hatchbacks Tiago and Altroz are registering Tata’s presence in the segment that has been Maruti Suzuki's mainstay. 

No wonder, therefore, that the Tatas have delivered sales of over 20,000 units for three consecutive months, and is targeting a production of 25,000 units a month in Q4. And it is seeking assurance from vendors to make up to 40,000 units a month in FY-22, with a new Micro SUV Hornbill and top-of-the-line SUV Gravitas planned for the next financial year. 

Tata Motors is currently sitting on an order book position of about 30,000 to 35,000 units, with traction for its hatchbacks Altroz and Tiago. The smaller sibling Tiago in fact saw a significant leg up in volumes due to the need for personal mobility.

Declining to give any specific numbers on booking numbers or production, Shailesh Chandra, President, PVBU, Tata Motors told ET that to cater to the rising demand, the company has been ramping up capacities, especially of petrol vehicles.

“We continue to follow a strong ‘Supply and Operations Planning’ cadence to align production to retail in order to avoid mismatches and keeping a lean inventory across the value chain. We do expect continued growth in our demand on the back of the current “New Forever” range along with the new products to be launched in the coming calendar year,” added Chandra. 

In the eight months of this financial year, Tata Motors is estimated to have sold over 1.13 lakh passenger vehicles, registering a growth of over 15%.




According to people in the know, Tata Motors may close FY-21 with sales of 1.75 lakh units, meaning growth of over up to 25%.

But looking at the booking momentum for the brand, there is every possibility that sales may cross 2 lakh units in annual volumes, which means it would have registered a growth of 30-40%. 

“The capacity planning is always done on the higher side; if the planning goes wrong, you can’t capitalize on the buying momentum and the top rivals Maruti and Hyundai can take full advantage of Tata Motors’ slack,” said a person close to the company.

To ensure preparedness to meet the demand, the company is continuously working on debottlenecking with its suppliers.

Tata Motors has already overtaken its arch rival Mahindra & Mahindra to grab the number three position and it has seen its market share jump by almost 300 basis points to 8% in FY-21 so far. The company has broken into double digit market share for both passenger cars and in the utility vehicle segments."

Tata Motors,"Nov 27, 2020, 10:05 PM IST",Kia Motors breaks into operating profit in its first year of India journey,"MUMBAI: South Korean automaker Kia Motors has become one of the quickest to turn operationally profitable in India’s highly competitive passenger vehicle market.

In fiscal 2020, the first year of its operation in India, the company produced more than 100,000 vehicles and posted revenue of Rs 10,838 crore, when the domestic market delivered its worst performance in a decade.

Kia posted an operating profit, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, of Rs 308 crore in the year ended March 31, 2020, according to its filings with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. Interest pay-out and a significant depreciation cost, however, pulled Kia into a net loss of Rs 326 crore for the year.

In the ongoing fiscal 2021, if Kia manages to attain its target of producing 200,000 vehicles, the company may post a turnover of nearly $2.4 billion (Rs 17,000 crore), as per ETIG analysis.

It had sold more than 105,000 units in the last fiscal year where exports contributed about a fifth of the total volumes.

In a market where global behemoths like General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen struggled to cross a 2-3% market share even after being present for over a decade, Kia has grabbed a 5% market share so far in FY21 and is knocking at the podium just behind Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra.

With just three products in its portfolio, which are all utility vehicles, Kia now has a 13-15% market share in the segment.

The combined turnover of Kia and sister company Hyundai Motor in India was 63% of market leader Maruti Suzuki's turnover in FY20. Their combined market share was about 23-24%.

Kia had invested Rs 8,771 crore in its Indian operations till FY20, out of which Rs 2,501 crore was made in the previous year.

Its average realisation per vehicle was Rs 10.2 lakh in FY20, which was 1.5-2.1 times that of the top two car makers — Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai.

The revenue of Kia was nearly equivalent to the passenger vehicle division of Tata Motors, however there is a sharp contrast in the operating profit picture of the two companies. Kia posted a margin of 2.9% in FY20, while for Tata Motors, it was a negative 9.8%.

The operating profit margin of Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai were 9.7% and 10.06%, respectively.

Five of these stocks have consensus ‘buy’, two have 'hold' while one an ‘underperform’ ratings now.


These list includes:


IndusInd Bank: Outperform
Up 174 per cent since March 24, this banking stock has 18 'buy' calls, 12 'outperform', 10 ‘hold’, three 'underperform' and two 'sell' ratings, as per publicly available Reuters' Eikon database. Analysts said the recent capital raising has strengthened the balance sheet and the bank may gradually see improvement in profitability as credit costs normalise. Nomura India expects a credit cost of 310 basis points for FY21 and 190 bps for FY22. It pegs loan growth for the bank at 4 per cent for FY21 and 12 per cent for ROE is seen at 8 per cent for FY21 and 12 per cent for FY22.


M&M: Outperform
Shares of this automaker have 16 'buy' calls, 18 'outperform', two 'hold', one 'underperform' and two 'sell' calls. Phillip Capital expects M&M to benefit from relatively buoyant sentiment in the rural economy due to good Rabi harvest, expectation of high Kharif harvest and higher MSPs. The brokerage in a note said that light commercial vehicles are doing well and the launch of Thar followed by Scorpio and XUV500 facelifts should shore up personal vehicle volumes.

“The company continues to follow up on its commitment to address capital allocation concerns by being prudent and culling loss making subsidiaries gives us comfort,"" the brokerage noted. The stock is up 169 per cent since March 24 against Nifty's 75 per cent rise.


Tata Motors: Hold
In a note this week, Edelweiss said it is positive on JLR’s upcoming product pipeline, which will improve its mix towards the more profitable Land Rover brand. Demand across some of its key markets should normalise it said, adding that a tight cost control should bolster profitability.

""We believe the capex cycle has peaked and containing capex spend should also spur JLR’s FCF. For the India business, after two years of slowdown, we expect volumes to recover gradually,"" it said. FCF stands for free cash flow,"" it said. HDFC Institutional Equities has also upgraded the stock to ‘buy’. While brokerages are turning positive on the stock, the stock still has a consensus 'hold' rating, as per Reuters' Eikon database, following a 153 per cent rise since March 24.


Hindalco: Buy
This aluminium maker has 13 'buy' and 10 'outperform' calls, but no 'hold', 'underperform' or 'sell' calls. JM Financial said Hindalco’s strategic capital allocation in downstream rolling (Novelis, Aleris) has helped the company establish itself as a market leader in aluminium rolled products, revamping its legacy business model of being an aluminium manufacturer and reducing Ebitda volatility vis-à-vis peers in the process.

“India operations with its 90 per cent plus coal security stands to benefit disproportionately with the rise in LME aluminium price. Hindalco’s investment appeal comes from the rising volumes at Novelis enabling operating leverage to kick-in, FCF yield of 13-16 per cent over FY22E-FY23 making way for significant de-leveraging, now that the bulk of the capex is behind,"" it said. The stock is up 153 per cent since March 24.


JSW Steel: Hold
This steel stock has four 'buy', four 'outperform' 13 'hold', six 'underperform' and three 'sell' ratings. Analysts said while volume improvement is all likely, iron ore cost to the company may stay high despite improving integration, as captive iron ore is coming at a huge premium and would thus limit spread improvement. High debt and tendency for continuous expansion keeps them cautious following a 132 per cent rise in the stock since March 24. The company so far is not expecting net debt to increase in FY21, excluding that related to Bhushan power acquisition.


Grasim: Outperform
This auto stock has two 'buy', four 'outperform' and five 'hold' calls. It has no ‘underperform’ or ‘sell’ ratings, as per Reuters' database. Edelweiss said Grasim is a value play as its 57 per cent stake in UltraTech Cement alone, excluding the holding company, and exceeds its current market-cap by 46 per cent. “With the worst being largely behind for standalone business and management’s focus on prioritising capital for organic growth is positive,” the brokerage said.

The risk of investment in group companies like Vodafone Idea remains a key overhang and the reason behind the holding company discount, said Kotak Securities which has an 'add' rating on the stock. The stock is up 114 per cent since March 24.


RIL: Outperform
This stock has 11 'buy' calls, nine 'outperform' seven 'hold', four 'underperform' and one 'sell' ratings. Prabhudas Lilladher said the company's stated objective is to monetise and forge global partnership across businesses, is well positioned to incubate new business and pursue inorganic opportunities given its liquid balance sheet. “Despite a sharp run-up in stock prices, we believe positive news flow on global partnerships or stake sale is likely to keep valuations at elevated level,” it said in a note. This stock has gained 111 per cent since March lows.


Wipro: Underperform
The IT stock, which has rallied 100 per cent since March 24, is a consensus ‘underperform’, as per Reuters. At its analyst day, Wipro’s MD & CEO Thierry Delaporte shared his plan for a bolder Wipro and to revive the company's growth by having a high performance culture and simplification of its organisation structure. Following that, IDBI Capital has introduced its FY23 financials and forecast revenue and upgraded the stock's target to Rs 366 based on PE of 18 times FY23, which is near to the top-end of the one-year forward P/E range of 10-21 times in the last five years.

Tata Motors,"Nov 26, 2020, 08:34 PM IST",Indian carmakers beat their foreign counterparts in vehicle crash safety,"MUMBAI: Domestic automakers have led the way when it comes to making safer cars for Indian roads. Seven out of the 10 safest affordable cars plying on Indian roads are made by Tata Motors and Mahindra and Mahindra, as assessed by Global New Car Assessment Programme (G-NCAP), an initiative by a UK-based charity that lobbies for safer cars around the world.

In fact, Indian automakers were the only ones to score 5 stars on a scale of 5 for adult occupant safety in the event of a high-speed collision.

“Global NCAP is neutral in terms of origin of different car companies. But it is pleasing to see Tata and Mahindra do so well in our ‘Safer Cars For India’ ratings,” said David Ward, president of Global NCAP.

“India’s made huge progress in the last few years. It is the country that has improved the most in the last decade,” he told ET in a recent interview.

The organisation has crash-tested as many as 42 cars sold in the Indian market since 2014. Of these, it found Mahindra XUV 300, Tata Altroz and Tata Nexon to be the safest.

“My 1st source of pride is that the 5 safest cars in India are Indian,” Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra said on Twitter.

To be sure, most of the vehicles tested so far come with a price tag below Rs 10 lakh and many premium cars sold by foreign automakers have not been tested. These vehicles could be safer if crash tested.

Other cars to excel on the test include Mahindra Thar, which got a 4-star rating earlier this week. Tata Tiago and Tigor, Volkswagen Polo, Mahindra Marazzo, Toyota’s now-discontinued Etios and Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza also feature amongst the top-10 on the list.

Foreign automakers have been criticised for making the same cars safer for export to other countries than the ones sold in India. A recently-launched high-selling SUV in India fared much better on crash tests in the US.

“It often depends on regulatory standards. For example, in most high-income countries electronic stability control (ESC) is mandatory but is not yet in India. Since the adoption of India’s crash test standards, it is more likely that the body shell strength will be more similar. Other differences may relate to number of air bags fitted,” Ward said.

Global NCAP attracted a sharp response from Maruti Suzuki when it rated the S-Presso as a 0-star car earlier this month. The market leader in a press statement said that all its vehicles were compliant with global safety standards and were duly tested and certified by the Indian government. 

“It cannot be left to the opinion of any self-proclaimed party,” Maruti Suzuki's statement read."

Two major events -- short covering ahead of November 2020 F&O expiry and rebalancing of MSCI portfolios -- helped the Indian market to recover sharply from lower levels. The Nifty50 index regained 13,000 levels and is now exhibiting remarkable strength. The unusual support from commodities and financials always helps the market move forward. Technically, for the next two days, 13,070 and 13,150 levels would be major hurdles for the index. If the Nifty50 index crosses 13,150, it could jump to 13,350 levels. However, below 12,930, the index would invite worries in the near term.

Tata Motors,"Nov 24, 2020, 11:38 AM IST","Maruti Suzuki enthused by festive response, output estimate raised for November to March","Mumbai: Maruti Suzuki has raised its production estimate for the rest of this fiscal year, encouraged by strong sales during the just-concluded festive season and a long order backlog, people in the know of its plans said.

The output in November and December was expected to be cut as demand usually weakens after the festive season. Instead, Maruti Suzuki has guided for a 2-11% higher production compared with what it had projected in August for the November to March period.

The maker of the Swift hatchback and Vitara Breeza SUV is eyeing production of 525,000-550,000 units, including output from parent Suzuki Motor’s Gujarat plant, in the fiscal fourth quarter of January-March. That would be at least 27% more from a year earlier and exceed the around 500,000 units it sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2019, which is the highest on record in a quarter for the company.

“The company is hoping to sell 20% more in the five months (November to March) of the fiscal than what it did in the first seven months of FY21,” one of the people said on the condition of anonymity.

Achieving those numbers will help Maruti Suzuki limit the drop in its fiscal 2021 output to 5-8%, compared with a 20% decline forecast by parent Suzuki Motor and 13-14% factored in by analysts.

An email sent to the company seeking comment did not elicit any response till the time of going to press on Monday.

A single-digit decline in sales at the market leader, along with sustained demand for rivals Hyundai Motor, Kia, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors that are also sitting on pending bookings, would help the passenger vehicle industry post a lower-than-expected decline in fiscal 2021 numbers.

At the second-quarter earnings conference, Maruti Suzuki had expressed visibility of demand till December, but had said it was unsure of demand sustaining beyond that. But a strong production schedule now indicates that the pent-up demand is likely to continue well into the fourth quarter. 


The company had sold 5,87,345 units in the April to October period, a 27% drop from the year-earlier period after the pandemic and lockdown crippled production and the market in the first few months.

It produced 166,086 units in September and 182,490 units in October, up 25% and 53%, respectively, from a year earlier. The tentative monthly schedule of the fourth quarter is quite similar to the production in October. 

Strong demand during the festivals had helped Maruti Suzuki cut cash discounts, which on average dropped by nearly 20% from the previous month."

Will it continue dream run?,"Mumbai: Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) return to profitability, improving demand outlook, deleveraging plans and a stake buy by Big Bull seem to be boding well for the Tata Motors stock.

While there has been a spurt in optimism over the prospects of the automaker, analysts are divided as to whether it is a good buy at this point of time.

Over the past one month, the stock has raced ahead more than 30 per cent, with over half the gains coming in last one week. However, for the year to date, the stock is still down about 9 per cent.

The stock is down 60 per cent for last three years, 58 per cent for five years and 28 per cent for last 10 years.

Analysts have turned more bullish on the stock in last one month. The stock currently has 10 ‘strong buy’, 8 ‘buy’, 7 ‘hold’, 7 ‘sell’ and 2 ‘strong sell’ ratings, data from Reuters Eikon showed. This compares with 7 ‘strong buy’, 9 ‘buy’, 9 ‘hold’, 7 ‘sell’ and 2 ‘strong sell’ ratings it had a month ago.

While foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have raised their stake in the stock by 22 basis points in September quarter to 15.84 per cent, they have trimmed their holding at least since June, 2019, data from Marketsmojo.com showed.

Mutual funds, on the other hand, have consistently trimmed their holdings in the stock since September 2019, and currently hold 5.60 per cent stake.

Tata Motors’ losses widened to Rs 307 crore during September quarter from Rs 188 crore a year ago, as sales continued to be lower than that in the previous year. However, the company performed better than market expectations on the back of cost savings and deferred tax credit.

JLR, which accounts for about 80 per cent of the company’s revenue, returned to profitability with a pre-tax profit of £65 million. Revenue declined 29 per cent to £4,352 million.

He told ETNow in October that he was confident of the company’s plans to become debt free. At the company's 75th annual general meeting (AGM) on August 25, Tata Motors Chairman N Chandrasekaran said the company was eyeing ‘near-zero’ debt over next three years, as it looks to significantly deleverage the business, cut expenses and put a leash on non-core investment.

“Impossible is the word for fools in my dictionary. Chandra would not talk on anything at the AGM unless he has a plan for it,” Jhunjhunwala had said.

“I have not taken a particular company or bought it because it belongs to Tata Group. I have bought it because of the company and because of what Tata Sons is doing. The emphasis is on cash flow and the correct business policies,” he said, explaining his interest in Tata companies.

Separately, promoter Tata Sons hiked its holdings in Tata Motors DVR to 7.14 per cent at the end of September from 5.26 per cent at the end of June.

Hemang Jani, Head of Equity Strategy for broking & distribution at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said the announcement to turn debt free has provided a renewed boost to the stock.

“They seem to be making progress on it by exiting some assets and geographies, and at the same time the business is showing an uptick. That is giving a lot of comfort to investors,” said Jani.

“It will not be a stock where people want to have a larger allocation because of the way it has been moving and because of the moving parts around it. But I think it definitely merits investments in small proportions,” he said.

On November 11, HDFC Securities upgraded the stock to ‘buy’ from ‘add’ earlier, saying the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) will benefit from improving demand outlook, cost-cutting initiatives, and better FCF generation.

“JLR’s retail volumes are improving from Covid lows, and system inventories are normalising. We are building in double-digit volume growth at JLR over FY22/23E (12/11 per cent). The luxury OEM has turned FCF positive (+GBP 463 million in 2Q), a trend which we expect would sustain over FY22/23E,” HDFC Securities said in a note.

The brokerage said the loss-making India passenger vehicle (PV) business has turned the corner and reported a positive margin, driven by robust market share gains. This will improve domestic cash flows and make the PV business more attractive for potential partners.

While the fundamentals remain supportive, not everyone believes it was time to stock up on the scrip. “The next trigger for the stock is going to be the demerger of the passenger car unit. The scrappage policy can also boost the stock. JLR is doing well too,” said independent analyst Ambareesh Baliga

“However, I would be a bit cautious on the stock at current level. We need to see whether the recent uptick in volumes is sustainable or not. There are discrepancies on what manufacturers across the board are claiming and the channel checks with dealers,” he said."
Tata Motors,"Nov 20, 2020, 07:56 PM IST",Daimler India losses halve in FY20; co reports 21% rise in operating profit,"Mumbai: Despite a tough year for commercial vehicles in FY-20, the Indian subsidiary of the world's largest medium and heavy truck maker Daimler halved its losses in India, backed by extensive cost cuts and boost to exports. 

The maker of Bharat Benz truck registered a net loss of Rs 109 crore for FY-20 versus Rs 230 crore loss incurred in FY-19. The total revenue for the company slipped 30% to Rs 5,740 crore vs Rs 8,299 crore in FY-19.

Led by improved operating performance and higher responsibility given to India by the global office in terms of development, sourcing and exports, DICV announced close to $300 million investment in India in May of 2020 for the period of next three to five years

Raw material optimization and tight control on the overheads resulted in DICV improving operating profit margins by 264 basis points to 6.13% in FY20 compared with the previous fiscal, according to the company’s annual filing to the corporate affairs department.

The decline in raw material and other expenses was substantially lower than the drop in revenue. As a result, the operating profit rose 21% to Rs 352 crore. Consequently, it has been able to expand margins in challenging times. Operating margin of DICV is better than India’s largest truck maker Tata Motors, but slightly lower than Ashok Leyland’s.

The operating profit margins of CV division of the Tata Motors fell to 4.2% in FY20, a decline of 680 basis points, while Ashok Leyland dropped 410 basis points to 6.7%.

Reviewing FY-20, the director’s report stated the spread of COVID-19 across the globe and India has contributed to a significant decline and volatility in economic activity and financial markets.

The company management has considered the possible effects that may result from the pandemic relating to COVID-19 on the carrying amount of the assets of the Company.

“Based on the current indicators of future economic conditions, the management expects to recover the carrying amount of the assets,” added the statement.

With volumes coming back to positive territory in July to September quarter, Daimler India expects a sustained improvement in its operations. 

Speaking on the recent demand recovery Satyakam Arya, MD & CEO Daimler India Commercial Vehicle, told ET that post-lockdown, demand is definitely moving up.

“Our sales for August showed double digit growth compared to 2019. For Q3 as a whole, our unit sales are up 5% compared to last year (2817 vs. 2672 as stated in the Q3 fact sheet). In overseas markets also, we are doing well,” he said.

At home, even as demand recovers, the company is expanding reach; by end of 2020, its network will exceed 250 touch-points. As for the overseas market, the company crossed its cumulative exports milestone of 35,000 units, 5,500 completely knocked units and 150 million parts exports.

To be sure, the company generated about 70% of its business by selling commercial vehicles, whereas 30% is generated from other business process management and outsourcing services.

“The early clearance of our BSIV stock before the April 1 deadline allowed the company’s dealers to focus on the sale of our new BSVI portfolio, which has helped in improvement of volumes in July to September,” Arya said.

DICV revenue in the previous fiscal was equivalent to 32% of Ashok Leyland and 15% of Tata Motors.

Given that the average realization of DICV is likely to be higher than the two leading CV makers as it only sells fully built trucks that fetch higher realization, the revenue market share of DICV could be higher than volume share.

In the previous fiscal year, Ashok Leyland had an average realization per vehicle of Rs 13.94 lakh.

According to the Federation of Automotive Dealers Association data of October 2020, DICV had a market share of 1.9% in the commercial vehicle market in India and it has witnessed 37 basis points improvement over the last year."
Nestle India,"Dec 17, 2020, 10:36 AM IST",These Nifty stocks hit record highs this week. Can they add to gains?,"MUMBAI: As benchmark Nifty ruled at a record high on Wednesday, six of its components scaled all-time highs this week. Here’s a quick look at these top performers, and what has driven them up.


Adani Ports and SEZ: The Adani Group stock scaled a record high, as analysts upped their price targets on the private multi-port operator, on the back of a faster-than-expected turnaround in its recently acquired Krishnapatnam Port. The stock has gained 30 per cent year to date, and is up more than 134 per cent from its March lows.


Bajaj Finance: With Bajaj Finance shares ruling at record high levels, investors are now anxious if this multibagger will continue the uptrend. However, the stock has seen fatigue set in after multiplying nearly three times from its March lows. The Sensex stock had tumbled more than 50 per cent in March, when the onset of Covid-19 pandemic rattled markets, and had tumbled to a 52-week low of Rs 1,783.10 on May 27. Since then, it has risen nearly 3 times.


Kotak Mahindra Bank: This private lender scaled a record high on Wednesday, performing gradually but consistently on the bourses. Earlier this week, RBI approved the re-appointment of Uday Kotak as the bank’s Managing Director for a further period of three years. The stock is up 16 per cent for the year to date, and has recovered more than 95 per cent from its March lows.


Titan: Big Bull Rakesh Jhunjhunwala’s prized possession Titan has hit a record high, buoyed by robust festive season sales, and as investors preferred industry leaders in a market where valuations have entered the expensive zone. The stock is up 27 per cent year to date, and has more than doubled from its 52-week low hit in March.


Asian Paints: The country’s top paint maker has been true to its multibagger tag, and has been hitting new highs. At the start of second half of 2020, the stock started recovering on the back of pentup demand after the lockdown curbs eased. Amit Syngle, MD & CEO told ETNow that sustainable new demand has emerged. The stock has gained 45 per cent for the year to date, and is up more than 80 per cent from March lows.


Nestle India: The fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firm logged new highs, riding the wave of urban as well as rural demand. The stock is up 24 per cent year to date, and is up more than 50 per cent from its March lows."

Speaking at a webinar, the market veteran said benchmark equity Sensex was somewhere around the 800-mark in 1987-88 when he joined the markets. Now, it is hovering at record high levels of over 44,500 levels. This shows the index has managed to deliver over 13 per cent CAGR return (without counting dividends) despite some major hiccups like the Kargil War, Global Financial Crisis and change in governments, among others.

“Time spent with high quality businesses is more important than timing the market,” Damani said, adding that India is aspiring to become the third largest economy from a Third World country.

The ace stock-picker said there are lots of opportunities in every sector, including retail, cement and technologies. “Investors who have stayed bullish on this country and invested in high quality businesses have made a fortune,” he said.

Historical data of blue chip companies, which are a part of the BSE Sensex now, shows players like Bajaj Finance have rallied 1,86,303 per cent over the past 20 years. Titan, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Asian Paints, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and L&T have gained between 5,500 per cent and 52,500 per cent during this period.

Other players like HDFC, IndusInd Bank, M&M, Sun Pharma, Nestle India, RIL, ICICI Bank, SBI, HUL and ITC also gained between 1,000 per cent and 4,500 per cent since November 2020.

So have the rules of investing changed now? Damani said the Law of Gravity cannot change. The same thing applies to the rule of investing. These are the universal principles.

“To pick the right stock, you have to buy good business with some margin of safety. Investors should also invest with a long-term view and pay less than what you expect a few years from now. These principles will never change,” he said.

Damani highlighted the fact that the market moves between fear and greed and this pendulum keeps on swinging. Therefore, the concept of buying with a margin of safety is never going to change.

Nestle India,"Nov 18, 2020, 05:19 PM IST",Post-Diwali demand critical; consumers in small markets 'true heroes' of pandemic: Nestle India MD,"NEW DELHI: Industry needs to watch out for consumption trends in the post Diwali phase closely as demand peaked because of festive buying in the past one month, Nestle India managing director Suresh Narayanan said at a round table meeting on Wednesday. “The next two-three months are critical to see if economic revival is here to stay,” Narayanan, who leads India’s biggest pure play packaged foods company, said.

He said consumers in tier-2 and rural markets, some below population of a lakh, have emerged as the “true heroes” of the pandemic as demand uptick in mega metros and metros was a lot more difficult because of pandemic-induced disruptions and lockdowns. For the maker of Maggi instant noodles and ketchup, Nescafe coffee and KitKat and Munch chocolates, smaller markets are growing twice as fast compared to the larger metros riding on 'operational efficiencies', while growth in rural markets has outpaced that of urban India, reversing the trend of previous years.

“The government has put out powerful schemes such as production-linked incentive scheme, but we will have to give time to see how these pan out and if the economy has stabilised; the next couple of months are critical,” Narayanan said.

Last week, the government announced a Rs 10,900 crore package for food processing under the production-linked incentive scheme, which includes incentives on ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook foods, dairy products like cheese and fruits and vegetables. Analysts say the incentives are positive for packaged foods companies as these will encourage production and benefit both manufacturers with economies of scale and consumers who would get better prices.

Narayanan said he expects demand in urban markets to rebound, or be 'reasonably positive' next year, with the threat of jobs diminishing gradually and incomes stabilising. Out-of-home consumption which had completely shrunk since April, is now returning gradually, he said.

The India unit of the Swiss foods giant has committed fresh investments of Rs 2,600 crore over the next three to four years, to address underlying growth.

“We are at the lower end of the Covid curve so hopefully economic activity will improve. We expect consumer need for safe, hygienic and healthy brands to continue,” Narayanan said.

Nestle, which competes aggressively with Britannia and ITC Foods, has traditionally been an urban-focused company, but is increasing the number of distribution outreach points in tier-2 markets and accelerating reach of smaller packs of its noodles, chocolates and coffee brands to leverage demand in these markets. “We are increasing the number of outreach points and have doubled wholesale hubs, in addition to distributors and re-distributors to enhance the geographic reach and width of distribution,"" Narayanan added. Nestle has doubled its distribution reach to 90,000 villages over the last 12 to 18 months.

Most large consumer goods companies have reported higher rural demand compared to urban fuelled by good monsoons, lesser pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions and government sops. Besides higher minimum support prices for farmers, the economic package that gave Rs 40,000 crore under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act over the earlier allocation of Rs 61,000 crore has also led to higher employment in villages.

Nestle reported more or less equal growth in urban and rural markets till the fourth quarter of 2019, after which, in the first quarter of 2020, urban grew faster than rural. However, by the third quarter, urban growth was 6% and rural markets were growing upwards of 12%, Narayanan said, reversing the growth pattern.

Urban markets contribute about 75-80% of Nestle’s overall business, with rural markets accounting for the remaining 20-25%.

The company is also reinforcing its e-commerce strategy, riding on record sales in the third quarter, Narayanan said."

Nestle India,"Oct 26, 2020, 01:20 PM IST","A host of rating upgrades for Nestle India but upside limited, say analysts","NEW DELHI: Brokerages had a lukewarm response to Nestle India’s third quarter earnings in which the company surprised analysts with its double digit revenue growth, but the upside in share prices seem to be limited.

A number of domestic and global brokerages including Nomura, IDBI Capital, Emkay Research and Prabhudas Lilladher, upgraded their ratings on the FMCG major but are concerned about its rich valuation.

“We believe the strong revenue growth and margin expansion would continue, going forward, given the slew of new launches is increasing the contribution to sales and benign commodity prices scenario is here to stay. The stock is trading at premium valuation multiples,” said Sanjay Manyal of ICICI Securities who has a hold rating on the scrip with target at Rs 18,000, which means an upside of 13 per cent.

For July-September period, the company reported 1.37 per cent year-on-year fall in net profit at Rs 587.09 crore. Revenue of the company increased 10 per cent YoY to Rs 3,541.70 crore. Nestle India has also declared an interim dividend of Rs 135 per equity share.

Nomura, which upgraded the stock to ‘buy’, said it believes Nestle’s massive capex plan of Rs 2,600 crore over the next 3-4 years towards augmenting existing capacities and construction of the Sanand factory (exclusively for Maggi production) will likely propel revenues to a higher plane in the medium to long term.

It has a target of Rs 18,925 (potential upside of 19 per cent) on the Maggi maker, as it sees current valuations as favourable. However, it counts slower demand in core products as a key risk to the target price.

Analysts said company’s revenue growth was driven by a rise in at-home consumption while out-of-home consumption also saw improvement. There was strong growth in tier 2, tier 3 cities and sale through e-commerce platforms also helped the cause. 

“The company resumed double-digit sales growth, which appears likely to sustain given the continued benefits of an in-home consumption boost. Lower milk, wheat, and sugar costs also led to sequential gross margin improvement. Consequently, Ebitda also grew in double-digits, a first after seven quarters,” said Krishnan Sambamoorthy, a research analyst at Motilal Oswal.

While the structural investment case is strong, valuations of 64.9 times CY22 and 55.9 times CY23 EPS do not offer any material upside potential from a one-year perspective, Sambamoorthy said. He maintains a ‘neutral’ stance on the stock with a target at Rs 16,440, which translates into a potential upside of 4 per cent.

The initial reaction to the earnings was encouraging as shares of the company were trading 2.36 per cent higher at Rs 16,236.90 in Monday trading.

IDBI Capital has ‘accumulate’ rating while Emkay and Prabhudas Lilladher advise ‘holding’ the scrip as they also see a negligible upside from a one-year perspective."

Nestle India,"Oct 22, 2020, 04:58 PM IST",Nestle India Q2 preview: Maggi-maker to report flat profit growth,"NEW DELHI: Maggi-maker Nestle India is expected to clock a double-digit growth in sales during the September quarter but profit growth is likely to be muted given high tax rate in the base quarter and lower other income.

“Nestle may post 10 per cent revenue growth, led by high demand in its dairy, Maggi (28 per cent of sales) and coffee segments. Chocolates (25 per cent of sales) may continue to drag, with schools, colleges and offices being shut to a large extent,” said analysts at Elara Securities.

The company reported a 11 per cent profit rise for the June 2020 quarter at Rs 486.6 crore, with total sales at Rs 3,041.5 crore. In the September quarter last year, it reported a 33.46 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 595.41 crore.

KR Choksey Institutional Research expects Nestle India to report a revenue growth of 11.7 per cent YoY and 9.9 per cent QoQ on the back of increase in demand for ready-to-eat products such as Maggi, dairy products, KitKat and coffee as well as volume-led growth from online delivery channels.

“We foresee an increase in Ebitda margin due to operational efficiencies undertaken by the company and reduction in variable expenses, particularly ad spends, offset by rise in milk prices. The net profit margin is expected to increase by 55 bps YoY,” it further said.

Investec, which expects revenue at Rs 3,215.8 crore, up 9.2 per cent YoY and adjusted net profits at Rs 595.4 crore, down 0.7 per cent, also outlines a 10 per cent increase in sales led by higher in-home consumption demand led by prepared dishes and beverages.

“Decline in milk prices will lead to strong gross margin expansion. Higher tax rate versus base quarter will lead to muted profit growth,” the UK-based broker said.

Unlike its peers in the FMCG space, which have seen heavy demand from investors during the current year, Nestle has gained just 8 per cent year-to-date. But it still outperforms Sensex which is down about 2 per cent during the period.

Emkay Research said gross margins will likely expand QoQ due to low milk prices but are likely to be steady YoY. Controlled overhead costs will also aid Ebitda margin expansion by 170bps, it added.

It said the company may report revenue at Rs 3,454.4 crore, up 7.4 per cent and adjusted net profit at Rs 602 crore, flat YoY.

According to KRChoksey, key things to watch out for are:


Guidance on price and volume
Capacity utilization levels
Mix of segmental products
New product launches/innovations
Cost control initiatives"

M&M,"Dec 07, 2020, 11:55 PM IST","Commercial vehicle sales picking up, likely to regain peak, says VE Commercial Vehicles MD","NEW DELHI: Demand for commercial vehicles – a key indicator of economic activity – has started picking up and the industry is expected to get back on to the growth path in the next financial year, Vinod Aggarwal, managing director of VE Commercial Vehicles, told ET. 

Sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles in the country have declined 58% year on year between April and November, he said. 

“However, demand has improved over the past two months as the trucking industry is picking up,” Aggarwal said. “Going forward, with economic activity expected to better, sentiments are positive. With the possibility of (Covid-19) vaccine, the next financial year should bode much better for industry.”

Replacement demand for medium and heavy commercial vehicles, which had petered out the last three years, is expected to gain pace as economic activity increases and support growth in the segment. 

VE Commercial Vehicles, a joint venture between Volvo Group and Eicher Motors, is a small but significant player with about 5% share in the Indian commercial vehicle market, behind market leader Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra and Ashok Leyland.

While overall, sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles are still likely to decline by 40% in 2020-21, the industry is expected to grow thereafter and regain peak sales of 390,732 units registered in FY19 next fiscal year. 

Sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles had dropped by 42.47% to 224,806 units last fiscal.

Aggarwal said the excess capacity which had been released in the marked on account of a change in axle load norms has been absorbed. And, even though cost of acquisition of commercial vehicles have increased due to the implementation of BSVI emission norms, new trucks deliver higher productivity, and have lower overall cost of ownership, which would make them attractive for buyers, he said. 

VE Commercial Vehicles has invested Rs 350 crore in commissioning a new plant in Bhopal on Saturday to cash in on demand once the market revives. The company has earmarked an additional Rs 150 crore to set up a paint shop at the facility. The new unit will take the company’s total investment in Madhya Pradesh to over Rs 5,000 crore.

“Together with our facilities in Pithampur, we will now have the capacity to produce 130,000 units per annum,” Aggarwal said. “This puts us in a very good position because once the market improves, we will be able to take advantage of this investment and cash in on demand.”

The new manufacturing unit has initial installed capacity to roll out 40,000 units per annum.

With the commissioning of the new facility, Aggarwal said the company is at the close of an investment cycle. It will continue to invest Rs 300-400 crore every year as capex going forward, he said."

M&M,"Nov 30, 2020, 06:11 PM IST",Motown diaries: Stellar growth in tractor sales to boost November auto volumes,"NEW DELHI: A superb growth in tractor sales and strong demand for other vehicles, especially from rural India, will keep the auto sales numbers in the green as automakers start reporting data from Tuesday onwards. 

Auto sales have been improving for a few months now, especially riding on sustained demand from rural markets and festive sales. This is also seen in shares of auto companies, which have been on an upward trajectory.

“The automobiles industry is expected to continue to be on a roll in November with strong sales volumes driven by robust tractor sales, followed by passenger vehicles and two-wheeler sales,” Sharekhan said in a report.

The broker expects two-wheelers to register 20 per cent YoY growth led by Hero Moto and Bajaj Auto. The sales will be driven by higher offtake from semi-urban, tier-II and tier-III cities, it said. Passenger vehicle segment is expected to clock a 13.9 per cent YoY growth led by Maruti Suzuki and M&M, Sharekhan said.

Analysts say they have noticed a slowdown in the pace of wholesale volume growth month-on-month, but is likely to sustain growth in November, led by the festive season falling in the month of November versus October.


ETMarkets.com
“In terms of retail volumes, our checks indicate that cumulatively (Oct+Nov), passenger vehicles retails are up in single digits, while two-wheelers have declined in double digits YoY. Passenger vehicles sales have also been impacted by lower inventory days (<15 ), which should catch up over the coming months,” said Kapil Singh, an analyst at Nomura India.

“Rural demand remains strong and there is no slowdown. We have been highlighting that while rural demand has strong economic drivers, urban demand lacks those. As such, volumes of market leaders in rural segments, such as Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki and Hero Motocorp, are likely to outperform industry volumes in November in their respective segments,” Singh added.

Tractor sales, which he the analyst sees at 50 per cent, he added that if the momentum sustains, he sees upside risk to our estimate of 10 per cent YoY industry volume growth in FY21, compared to a decline for all other auto segments.

“We expect tractor sales to surge by 83 per cent YoY driven by higher farm incomes, robust Kharif sowing, a good monsoon and benefits of a low base of the previous year. Retail tractor retail sales grew by 55.5 per cent YoY in October, which explains the massive rise in demand,” Sharekhan said."

Cipla,"Dec 16, 2020, 09:09 AM IST",Dispute settlement gives this stock an edge over peers in pharma pack,"NEW DELHI: As the pharma sector continued to see a stupendous rally this calendar, one stock moved one step ahead of its peers, for what analysts attributed to a dispute settlement.

Cipla claims it has settled its dispute with Bristol Myers-owned Celgene over the drug, revlimid. Following the deal, which analysts had not accounted for, price targets for the stock rose to factor in the development.

Details of the dispute settlement are still confidential. What is known is that Cipla will launch the generic drug and will have a volume-limited licence to sell it sometime after March, 2022, and can launch unlimited quantities after Jan, 2026.

“We welcome the dispute settlement, as it provides visibility to the revenues expected in FY23 and FY24. While a rising number of settlements crowd this lucrative market, we do not foresee any impact to our base case at this stage,” said Kunal Randeria, analyst at Edelweiss Securities.

He sees Rs 35 per share gain from this settlement and hence raised the price target to Rs 945, suggesting a 20 per cent upside from current levels. Cipla shares have already surged over 120 per cent from March lows.

Revlimid is a lucrative drug and Bristol Myers, which invented it, generates $7.8 billion annually from it. Cipla has become the fourth player to settle the dispute after Natco Pharma, Alvogen and Dr Reddy’s Labs. Six more drug firms are still in dispute, awaiting settlement.

“The key point is there are volume market share constraints in all settlements, which would help limit the impact of growing competition. However, price erosion could be higher than prior estimates,” said Sriraam Rathi, analyst at ICICI Securities.

At this stage, there is no clarity on the eventual number of competitors. If it gets bigger, then that could be a risk. Besides, lower-than-expected growth in India, slower ramp-up in Albuterol, delay in resolution of the warning letter over Goa facility, higher price erosion in the US market are other key risks for Cipla.

Kunal Dhamesha of Emkay Global raised his price target for the stock to Rs 1,000 and sees potential gain of Rs 45 per share from the settlement. His assessment is based on the assumption that Cipla’s settlement terms are in line with those of Alvogen.

“Cipla is in a sweet spot with key businesses witnessing strong growth momentum. While Covid drug sales could normalise in India, recovery in ex-Covid prescription business, structural cost savings and rampup in gAlbuterol share in the US are likely to drive earnings growth of about 28 per cent CAGR over FY20-23,” said Bansi Desai of HDFC Securities. 

However, the deal may prove negative to other pharma firms, which have the same product. Hence, brokerages have adjusted price targets for Cipla’s competitors.

ICICI Securities downgraded Natco Pharma to ‘hold’ from ‘add’ earlier and reduced price target to Rs 974 from Rs 998. Similarly, it has revised the target for Dr Reddy’s Labs to Rs 5,412 from Rs 5,485 earlier, though it maintained an ‘add’ rating on that stock."

Latest investment data showed the Nebraska-based company bought into Merck & Co, Pfizer, Abbvie and Bristol-Myers Squibb during the September quarter. This has made domestic investors wonder whether domestic pharma stocks can still more returns on the back of the recent strong rally.

While there are concerns as to whether pharma stocks are fully pricing in a Covid windfall, analysts suggest Indian pharma isn’t just a Covid theme, but beyond that. They still find many pharma stocks that can be bought at current levels.

Nomura India has cut its weightage on the pharma sector, but still holds an overweight rating on it. In its latest equity strategy report, the brokerage said the earnings upcycle in frontline pharma companies -- after a significant downcycle over last 4-5 years -- is here to stay.

The brokerage said the market would attribute higher valuation multiples to the pharma stocks, as there is further earnings visibility over next 12 months.

The brokerage has limited its top picks to the frontline companies with sustained earnings recovery, such as Dr Reddy’s Labs, Lupin and Sun Pharma. It has removed Jubilant Life Sciences and Glenmark Pharma from its portfolio.

Data showed the Sun Pharma stock has gained 63 per cent from its 52-week low of Rs 315 hit on March 23, but is still down 57 per cent from its April 2015 highs, as per the adjusted price data available with AceEquity.

In the broader market, equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty have been hitting new highs every other day.

Lupin shares have climbed 79 per cent since March 19 but are down 57.4 per cent from its October 2015 levels.

The stock of Dr Reddy’s, meanwhile, hit a fresh record of Rs 5,514.65 but is still trading 11 per cent below those levels. Jubilant Life Sciences has recovered 206 per cent from its 52-week lows, while Glenmark has gained 189 per cent. The two stocks are down 30-60 per cent from their lifetime highs.

“Covid-19 might have given pharma an additional tailwind, which got reflected over the past quarters and might even show up in a couple of quarters more to come, but that will normalise going forward. The domestic pharma companies have done a wonderful job in cutting costs. There might be some bunching up of orders partially due to Covid, but the undeniable fact is India is fast emerging as a generic powerhouse,” he said. 

Dharamshi said the pharma pack may see some consolidation rather than a steep correction in the pharma sector, until the story starts picking up again. “We are not very sure what percentage of growth that we have witnessed in the past couple of quarters will sustain. Once the market gets a better sense of that, there will be more to come. Pharma can give very good returns even from here on,” he said. 

Credit Suisse said India aims to administer 40-50 crore vaccine doses by July-2021. The key vaccines India is banking on are from Oxford/AstraZeneca, Novavax and J&J (temperature range is 2-8°C) and the earliest efficacy data is expected by end of November 2020 and December 2020, while vaccines can be rolled out in January in the best-case scenario.

The global brokerage said Aurobindo’s large viral vector vaccine facility (30 crore doses) should be ready by March-April next year. “The pricing could be higher in the export markets than in India, and profitability could be at Rs 20-25 per dose. Therefore, on a 30 crore dose capacity, Aurobindo could benefit from a potential Ebitda of Rs 600-750 crore, which would be 12-15 per cent of FY22 Ebitda,” it said. This brokerage has upgraded Aurobindo stock to ‘outperform’ from ‘neutral’.

It said Cadila also has a facility to make 10 crore doses, but it is for DNA vaccine and, therefore, it would not be able to manufacture vaccine from global players in the near term. “Cipla and Cadila have benefitted the most from the sale of Covid-19 treatment drugs (especially Remdesivir) during the September quarter and volume should drop substantially in FY22 on rise in vaccination,” CS said.

Ajay Srivastava, CEO, Dimensions Corporate Finance, wants to play the M&A theme in the pharma space with Tier-II stocks.

“You will not find the kind of returns coming from Sun and Dr Reddy’s; they will disappoint you. Shift your portfolio down to tier-II pharma companies more on the manufacturing side, which are going to get a major boost including the PLI. Do not lose hope on pharma. It is there to stay and you will get lots of good surprises from takeovers. PE players are gunning for those companies. Buy and keep, and you will get an offer very soon in the mail,” he said."

Remdesivir was developed by U.S. drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc, which cut its 2020 revenue forecast last month, citing lower-than-expected demand and difficulty in predicting sales of the treatment. Cipla is among several firms licensed to make and sell generic versions in developing nations.

Cipla's version, Cipremi, was commercially launched in July and costs just above $50 per 100 mg vial.

""From October onwards, (the company is) seeing very sharp increase in (remdesivir) monthly volumes ... there are no constraints on supplies now,"" Cipla's global chief financial officer, Kedar Upadhye, told Reuters.

He said the company had sold more than 300,000 vials of the drug across the country as of September.

Remdesivir has become the standard of care for patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19, with more than 50 countries including the United States approving its use.

But the World Health Organization (WHO) said last month that its global trial of COVID-19 therapies had found that remdesivir did not have a substantial effect on the length of patients' hospital stays or their chances of survival.

""In India, the protocols (on remdesivir) have not changed, and demand continues,"" Cipla's Upadhye said, adding that the company has also begun export of the drug to ""a few countries"" in the second quarter, without giving any other details.

Hero MotoCorp, which is the leader in the budget bike segment (100-110cc), is also in the process of developing electric two- wheelers for both mass and premium segments. 

 ""Our strategy is to create a full portfolio of premium across segments and across engine capacity. Towards this, we already launched XPulse and Xtreme in the 200cc and 160cc segment, respectively. Over the next few years, we will continue to fill this portfolio with more and more new models,"" Hero MotoCorp Chief Financial Officer Niranjan Gupta said in an analyst call. 

 The Harley-Davidson partnership accelerates and enhances the company's premium segment strategy, he added. 

 In September this year, Harley-Davidson announced discontinuation of sales and manufacturing operations in India, a decade after it started selling its premium bikes in the country. 

 In late-October, Hero MotoCorp and Harley-Davidson announced a partnership for the Indian market. As part of the deal, Hero MotoCorp will develop and sell a range of premium motorcycles under the Harley-Davidson brand name in the country. Besides, it will take care of service and parts requirements for Harley bikes. 

 Further, Hero MotoCorp would sell Harley accessories and general merchandise, riding gear and apparel through a network of brand-exclusive Harley-Davidson dealers and its existing sales network in the country. 

 ""The partnership is going to be mutually beneficial for both the companies and the ride together in the premium segment will be definitely enriching,"" Gupta said. 

 Commenting on a query on the company's strategy regarding electric vehicles, he said besides investing in Ather Energy, the two-wheeler major is also looking to develop its own products. 

 ""We continue to have over 30 per cent stake in Ather, our current stake is 34.6 per cent. And plus we continue to develop our own product as well,"" Gupta noted.

Hero MotoCorp,"Dec 02, 2020, 12:39 PM IST",Hero MotoCorp inducts 10 Harley Davidson dealers into network,"NEW DELHI: In a move that is expected to provide much-needed respite to the dealers and customers of Harley Davidson in the country, Hero MotoCorp has inducted 10 dealers of the American bike maker into its own distribution network. 

Several people aware of the development told ET that Hero MotoCorp has done due diligence of all the Harley dealers in the country, and has already signed around 10 of them. These contracts with Harley dealers will come into effect from January 1.

“Hero MotoCorp has acted swiftly to quickly rope in several of the Harley dealers, much ahead of the December 31 timeline when the contract of the dealers with Harley comes to an end. This is a positive development for Harley dealers as well as Harley bike owners in India,” a highly placed industry veteran close to the developments told ET. “Hero is very focused on this new line of business and is ensuring that everything happens very smoothly.”

Hero MotoCorp declined to comment.

India’s biggest bike maker, industry insiders said, is gearing up for a smooth transition that will give a leg-up to its uptrading journey. Over the past few years, Hero has launched a series of products in the premium segment – including the X-range of motorcycles - and has been ramping up the look and feel of its customer touch points to provide a premium experience to its customers. “Hero is keen to ensure that no Harley customer is faced with any issue with regard to services and spares,” said a second person in the know.

In September, Harley Davidson announced its exit from India as part of its global strategy. The company soon after announced an alliance with Hero MotoCorp for sales, aftersales and new product development in India. 

Since the announcement of Harley Davidson’s exit, however, the company’s existing dealers have repeatedly voiced their dissatisfaction with the compensation package offered by the company. Their contracts with Harley run until the end of 2020. 

“The decision of the Harley dealers to join the network of Hero MotoCorp will provide a much-needed respite to the dealers. At the same time, this is also reassuring for the Harley customers who were uncertain about the continued service and the availability of spare parts,” he added. Harley Davidson has 22 dealer partners across 33 touchpoints in India. In its 10-year play in India, the company has sold around 27,000 units. 

The Hero-Harley arrangement is expected to be beneficial for existing and potential Harley Davidson customers in India, as Hero’s extensive distribution and service network, spread throughout the country, would provide them a hassle-free ownership experience.

“While for Harley the partnership will serve to keep alive its brand and take care of existing users in the Indian market, for Hero the benefits will accrue from knowledge-sharing,” said V G Ramakrishnan, managing partner at Avanteum Advisors LLP. “The company will get access to technology to develop a range of premium motorcycles, which will help it challenge the likes of Royal Enfield.”"

Based out of India, Mike will join Hero MotoCorp effective January 1, 2021 and report to Pawan Munjal, Chairman & CEO of Hero MotoCorp. The Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) of Hero MotoCorp has approved the appointment.

Clarke’s appointment comes close on the heels of recent augmenting of the Leadership Team at Hero MotoCorp.

As part of this process, Hero MotoCorp has earlier announced assigning the role of Head of Strategy to Malo Le Masson and expanded the role of Ravi Pisipaty as the Head of Plant Operations. Sanjay Bhan has returned to the Company as the Head of Global Business (GB) to play a key role in the expansion and consolidation of Hero in the international markets. Mahesh Kaikini, the Head of Gurugram plant, has been appointed as the Chief Quality Officer, while Ashutosh Varma has been elevated to the role of Head of National Sales.

Clarke is a business leader with more than 25 years’ global experience in publicly listed companies in the US and UK, including Fiat Group SPA and Delphi Technologies.

Hero MotoCorp,"Nov 21, 2020, 12:21 PM IST",Harley-Davidson says working with partner Hero to ensure smooth transition for customers in India,"New Delhi: American cult-bike maker Harley-Davidson on Saturday said it is working with its new partner Hero MotoCorp to ""ensure a smooth transition"" for its customers in India, including after-sale services and warranty. Last month, Harley-Davidson and Hero MotoCorp announced their partnership for the Indian market. 

 They have inked a distribution agreement, under which Hero MotoCorp will sell and service Harley-Davidson motorcycles. It will also sell parts and accessories and general merchandise riding gear and apparel through a network of brand-exclusive Harley-Davidson dealers and Hero's existing dealership network in India. 

 Harley-Davidson Managing Director (Asia Emerging Markets and India) Sajeev Rajasekharan said in a statement, ""As we change our business model in India, we are pleased to be continuing our journey in the country together with Hero MotoCorp. We are working closely with Hero to ensure a smooth transition for our riders."" 

 He further said the company is providing its riders with updates as available. 

 The firm has assured them that Harley-Davidson motorcycle, parts and accessories and general merchandise sales, as well as after-sale services, warranty and H.O.G. (Harley Owners Group) activities will continue from January 2021 onwards, he added. 

 After the company announced its exit from India in September, Harley-Davidson's dealers said they are looking at taking legal action against the US bike manufacturer over measly compensation. 

 The Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations said the exit of the American cult-bike maker would lead to a loss of up to Rs 130 crore for the brand's dealer partners in the country along with job loss of up to 2,000 workers across the bike maker's dealerships."
Hero MotoCorp,"Nov 21, 2020, 09:53 AM IST",Multiple signs telling us D-Street’s catch-up rally is coming to an end,"The week after the festival season saw a huge gap-up start on the back of positive global clues. But the optimism faded soon after and fears of a resurgence in coronavirus cases, power tussle in the US and high stocks valuations eroded much of the value and Nifty could end only with a mild gain.

Massive FPI buying led to the biggest gap up rally in the past two weeks, which wasn’t visible during the entire lockdown period rally since April. This shows that optimism has reached its peak, at least from an intermediate point of view. Further, more than 10 stocks are getting included in the F&O ban list on a daily basis, and this suggests the market is hovering around its overbought levels. There is too much optimism and it is time for a healthy correction to cool down the charging bulls.

It would also be worth noting that even good news has not been able to lift stock prices of late. For instance, Hero MotoCorp saw the best Diwali sales in a decade and ended with all-time post-festive low inventory of less than four weeks at dealership levels. Yet, the stock could not sustain at higher levels. When positive news cannot take stock prices higher, it is an indication that the markets are in the overbought territory.

As soon as FPIs slow down their buying intensity before Christmas, the market may witness a healthy correction.

Equity funds, a major constituent of DIIs, witnessed an outflow for the fourth consecutive month in October, with investors moving out some Rs 2,725 crore compared with an outflow of Rs 734 crore in September. This seems to signal that equity fund managers continue to book profit at higher levels even as investors raise liquidity by selling mutual fund units.

It is quite astonishing that DIIs, a major market participant, have managed to sell equities worth net Rs 30,000 crore in the market so far this month. This shows that DIIs are already anticipating a correction and are one step ahead of the move.


Event of the Week
The US Treasury Secretary recently announced that key pandemic lending programmes would cease on December 31, 2020, and that decision has sent shivers down the spine across the world. The surprise termination of lending programmes would manifest itself into a grim economic outlook and may have a cascading negative effect on the global economy stung by the deadly virus.

Also, it seems unlikely that this decision would go down well with the Republicans and Democrats, as they would strive to alleviate the stress caused by the pandemic. With the impact of Biden’s victory and amid the power tussle between US Treasury Secretary and the US Fed, the market is expected to remain on its toes. But one thing is certain: all this indecisiveness could cause jittery on Dalal Street.


Technical Outlook
Nifty 50 ended the week gone by with a mild gain after making an all-time high of 12,963. But now the benchmark index has formed a bullish reversal pattern, which opened with a gap near the high point of the week and then gave up all the gains. The velocity of the rally has declined along with the volume participation. In fact, Nifty has been facing resistance at the rising channel, which is visible on the weekly chart, and might continue to struggle going ahead, as it lacks participation from the top index movers such as RIL, HDFC and banking stocks, who have become a bit stretched for the short term. We advise traders to keep an eye on the benchmark and go short unless Nifty breaks the rising channel on the upside.

ET CONTRIBUTORS
Expectations for the Week
Mr Market is likely to see some buying in the lower-order stocks, implying some sort of catch-up rally there. Industry laggards are now trying to catch up with the industry leaders in terms of price action. This process may continue as Nifty has formed an intermediate top and is likely to witness a correction in the frontline stocks. Further, smallcaps and midcaps may see a catch-up bounce. However, they may eventually imitate the frontline players and see a correction. India Inc’s quarterly earnings season has largely concluded and the bourses are likely to keep an eye on global clues and/or look for any major updates related to the vaccine for future direction.

Investors may look to book profit at current higher levels and wait for a correction before starting fresh buying. In addition to this, investors can look to accumulate quality IT and pharma names at current levels.

The Ministry of Railways, in a release dated December 11, 2020, stated that more than 2.44 crore candidates will be appearing in different cities across the country to participate in the recruitment drive.

According to the official release, the first phase of the exam will commence from December 15 till December 18, 2020, for isolated and ministerial categories. This will be followed by NTPC categories from December 28 to tentatively till March 2021 and the third recruitment for Level-1 from tentatively April 2020 onwards till June end, 2021.

RRBs have made extensive preparations for conducting examinations of this large scale in COVID-19 pandemic times following SOPs as laid down by the government ensuring social distancing, compulsory use of masks, sanitisers, curtailing shifts for conducting exams to only two shifts per day.

""Efforts are being made by RRBs to ensure that as far as possible the candidates are accommodated in their own State so that they can reach their exam centres by undertaking the overnight journey. Female and PWD candidates are accommodated within their home states. However, considering the skewed distribution of candidates area-wise, there will be unavoidable interstate movements. Railways will be running special exam trains to cater to the travel requirements of the candidates, wherever required and feasible. Chief Secretaries of concerned State Governments have also been requested to extend support of local administration to RRBs for conducting CBTs in secure and safe manner ensuring social distancing,"" the Indian Railways said.

According to the Indian Railways, candidates will be checked for the temperature at entry using thermo guns.

""Candidates having temperature more than prescribed limits will not be allowed inside the exam venue. Intimation in this regard will also be sent to their registered email and mobile number regarding the rescheduling of such candidates. The exact date of the re-scheduled exam of such candidates will be intimated subsequently. The candidate should use his/her own facemask. Candidate has to produce COVID-19 self-declaration in the prescribed format at the entry and in absence of the same he/she will not be allowed into the exam venue. After each shift the exam centre will be sanitised before starting another shift,"" it said.

In order to safeguard the health of the candidates and other personnel involved in the conduct of exams amid COVID-19, the latest instructions, guidelines, and orders issued by the Central and respective State governments concerning COVID 19 will be followed and ensured, the Indian Railways stated."

NTPC,"Dec 07, 2020, 07:02 AM IST",Why are HNIs making a beeline for CPSE ETF,"MUMBAI: Value is emerging from the shadow of growth – especially with the deep pocketed. That’s benefiting the CPSE ETF, which gained 13% in a fortnight.

What’s drawing the rich to a segment of the market that’s rather dull otherwise? There are several factors: Attractive PSU valuations, dividend yields that exceed bank deposit rates, tax arbitrage over direct equity and negligible expense ratio. Average volumes on the NSE have jumped to 14.7 million units in the past one week compared to an average of 3.3 million units in November.

With the market trading at an all-time high, wealth managers are looking for themes with a margin of safety – and are tax efficient, undervalued and help preserve capital.


The CPSE ETF has a dividend yield of 5.55%, PE of 10.68 and a PB of 1.09. By contrast, the Nifty 50 has a PE of 36.46, dividend yield of 1.2 and PB of 3.75.

“Undervaluation of stocks in the CPSE basket and high dividend yield make it an attractive bet,” said Rupesh Bhansali, head (distribution), GEPL Capital. He advised investors to take small bets.

The CPSE ETF is a passive investment scheme that was created to help the government to disinvest some of its stake in selected CPSEs. The government has so far offered units to investors in seven tranches since March 2014. The portfolio has 12 stocks, with four companies - Power Grid, NTPC, Coal India and ONGC – together making up 77% of the portfolio and has an expense ratio of less than 1 paisa. The ETF is down 14% in the last one year while over 3 years, it has lost an annualized 12%.

Analysts believe higher dividends from CPSEs, and the government decision to avoid frequent stake sales could lead to rerating of CPSE stocks. They believe these companies have profitable growth and many of them enjoy monopolies in their line of business.

JM Financial said in a report that even though CPSEs like NTPC and Coal India delivered profit growths of 8% and 3% in the period 2015-2021, their market capitalization eroded by 23% and 66%, largely led by ESG concerns and repeated government stake sales.

“Most stocks are trading at a steep discount to historic valuations as investors are not sure about the government’s direction. In the recent past, representatives from the government have been engaging with fund managers on ways to improve valuations,” said the CIO at a domestic fund house. 

Financial planners are also recommending ultra HNIs to take advantage of the high dividend yield and tax arbitrage through this product.

“From this financial year onwards dividend earned from shares is taxed in line with your tax slab, while if it is earned via the equity mutual fund route you pay only capital gains tax, which is far lower,” said Anup Bhaiya, MD and CEO, Money Honey Financial Services.

Given that the dividend yield of CPSE ETF is higher at 5.5% compared to bank fixed deposits that pay around 5%, and the tax advantage many HNIs are allocating a small portion of their fixed deposit portfolio to the CPSE ETF.

For example, dividends earned by a shareholder in a company will be taxed as per his tax bracket. So, ultra HNIs will pay 42% tax on dividends earned from equity. However, if the same was earned through a mutual fund, it will be added to the NAV and will reflect there. An investor holding such a mutual fund pays only long term tax of 10% if units are sold after a year, and 15% if within, thereby giving a tax arbitrage of up to 32%."
NTPC,"Dec 06, 2020, 05:32 PM IST",Lenders of Jhabua power plant are locked in tough negotiations with NTPC,"Lenders to the Avantha Group's distressed 600 MW Jhabua power plant are locked in tough negotiations over the completion of the deal with India's largest power generator NTPC almost a year after it was declared the winning bidder due to concerns over power demand due to the economic downturn caused by the Covid 19 pandemic. 

The bone of contention is the right over the Rs 400 crore earnings before interest tax and amortisation (EBITDA) that the distressed company has made this fiscal. Lenders say the amount should go to the creditors while NTPC says it has to go to the winning bidder.

""NTPC has said if creditors keep the EBITDA, it will reduce the price its offering from Rs 1900 crore to Rs 1100 crore. This is where the deal is stuck,"" said a person familiar with the discussions.

The deadlock over this asset highlights the challenges to debt resolution to distressed power plants in India beseiged by lack of power purchase agreements, coal linkages and the economic recession caused by the Covid 19 pandemic which has hurt corporate demand.

Jhabua was a success story in that sense as NTPC had outbid the Adani Group by two-and-a-half times and was the highest on a per-megawatt basis in terms of valuations of a stressed asset in the power sector, though at Rs 1900 crore was still a 62% haircut to the Rs 5000 crore debt owed by the company. The company was taken to the NCLT in May 2019 due to lack of working capital, despite it being an operational plant. The admission into NCLT was after restructuring by a group of lenders could not work out in 2018-19.

NTPC's bid values the unit at Rs 3.2 crore per mw against the construction cost of Rs 6 crore for new projects. Adani Power had valued it at about Rs 750 crore, or Rs 1.25 crore per mw.

Jhabua was also the first time that the state-run power producer had bid for any stressed project. The company has decided against buying any stressed projects outside the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

NTPC did not reply to an email seeking comment. However, a senior NTPC admitted that there were concerns regarding power purchase agreement (PPAs) between the plant and the state governments. 

Lenders are however confident that the differences will be resolved. ""Negotiations are going on and things will be addressed. It sometimes takes time but we trust NTPC will honour its commitment,"" said another person aware of the deal.

Lenders said the project has PPAs and NTPC has apprehensions that state discoms may renege the contracts due to lack of demand post Covid. Lenders have denied any possibility of price negotiations as the due process was followed under the IBC. NTPC has submitted a bank guarantee of Rs 5 crore for the project.

Getting resolution processes through is important for banks as bad loan recovery is slow and new cases to the NCLT under the bankruptcy law are suspended this fiscal because of a government order."
NTPC,"Dec 06, 2020, 03:44 PM IST",India plans to allow relinquished coal-fired plants to sell power,"BENGALURU: India's power ministry proposes letting coal-fired power plants keep selling power after completing their agreements with buyers, a letter seen by Reuters shows, despite national promises to close old plants to curb pollution.

 The proposal, if approved, would help old coal plants earn additional revenue, increase liquidity in short-term power markets and help distribution companies in states facing a power deficit access cheaper power, the ministry said in the draft proposal dated Friday.

 ""It is in the consumer interest to keep the tariff of electricity as low as possible,"" says the letter sent to power departments of India's states and the heads of federal government-run utilities such as NTPC Ltd.

 Such a move would enable federal-run electricity generators such as NTPC ""to sell power in any mode"" after distribution companies exit an agreement upon the completion of the tenure, the ministry said. 

 Power Minister R.K. Singh and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman have previously said they plan to shut old coal-fired power plants. The environment ministry has also pushed for shutting down coal plants, which account for 80% of India's industrial pollution, if they do not comply with green laws. 

 The outcome remains unclear. The power ministry has sought comments from the states and the heads of federal government-run power generators. A final decision on the proposal is not imminent.

 A senior power ministry official said on Sunday only inefficient plants would be shut down. 

 ""Cost-effective utilities that provide cheap power will still be allowed to operate. Small, inefficient plants will be shut down,"" the official said.

 Distribution companies operated by states such as Punjab, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha want to surrender power allocated by federal government-run utilities after the plants complete 25 years, the power ministry said.

 The states cited reasons such as the availability of excess power and high cost of electricity as reasons for surrendering power allotted to them under the agreements. 

 A list compiled by the power ministry in 2019 shows distribution companies wanted to surrender power generated from utilities with a capacity of 5.75 gigawatts."
NTPC,"Dec 06, 2020, 11:17 AM IST",Discoms' outstanding dues to power gencos rise over 29% to Rs 1.38 lakh crore in October,"New Delhi: Power producers' total dues owed by distribution firms rose over 29 per cent year-on-year to Rs 1,38,187 crore in October 2020, reflecting stress in the sector. Distribution companies (discoms) owed a total of Rs 1,06,734 crore to power generation firms in October 2019, according to portal PRAA (Payment Ratification And Analysis in Power procurement for bringing Transparency in Invoicing of generators).

 The portal was launched in May 2018 to bring in transparency in power purchase transactions between the generators and discoms. 

 In October 2020, the total overdue amount, which was not cleared even after 45 days of grace period offered by generators, stood at Rs 1,25,743 crore as against Rs 93,559 crore in the year-ago period.

 According to the latest data on the portal, total outstanding dues in October increased on a month-on-month basis as well. In September 2020, total outstanding dues of discoms stood at Rs 1,36,566 crore. The overdue amount in October 2020 has increased from Rs 1,24,675 crore in September 2020. 

 Power producers give 45 days to discoms for paying bills for the supply of electricity. After that, outstanding dues become overdue and generators charge penal interest on that in most cases. 

 In order to give relief to power generation companies (gencos), the Centre enforced a payment security mechanism from August 1, 2019. Under this mechanism, discoms are required to open letters of credit for getting power supply. 

 The central government had also given some breathers to discoms for paying dues to power generating companies (gencos) in view of COVID-19-induced lockdown. 

 The government had also waived penal charges for late payment of dues in the directive. In May, the government announced Rs 90,000 crore liquidity infusion for discoms under which these utilities would get loan at economical rates from Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and REC Ltd. This was an initiative of the government to help gencos to remain afloat. Later the liquidity infusion package was increased to Rs 1.2 lakh crore. 

 Discoms in Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Haryana and Tamil Nadu account for the major portion of dues to power gencos, data showed. 

 Overdues of independent power producers amount to 34.19 per cent of the total overdue of Rs 125,743 crore of discoms in October. The proportion of central PSU gencos in the overdue was 34.57 per cent. 

 Among the central public sector power generators, NTPC alone has an overdue amount of Rs 19,749.72 crore on discoms, followed by NLC India at Rs 6,694.42 crore, Damodar Valley Corporation at Rs 5,921.81 crore, NHPC at Rs 2,932.48 crore and THDC India at Rs 2,010.89 crore.

NTPC,"Nov 28, 2020, 11:31 AM IST","View: With rapid shut down of coal mines, energy transition and just transition must go togather","The writing is on the wall. A few days back, Coal India Limited (CIL), the world’s biggest coal producer and India’s largest CO2 emitter, announced its plans to become a ‘net-zero energy company’ by 2023-24. The company plans to install 3,000 MW of solar power to meet all its electricity demand, which will also reduce its power expenses. The foray into solar is part of CIL’s diversification plans to shift from a coal company to an energy company.

NTPC Limited, India’s largest coal-based power company, has won a bid this week to install 470 MW solar power at Rs 2.01/kWh. This tariff is 40% below the cost of existing coal power in India and less than half the price of new coal-fired power. NTPC has set up a separate renewable energy subsidiary – NTPC Renewable Energy – to build its green energy portfolio.

When the biggest coal mining and coal power companies see their future in renewable energy, it is time for the policy makers to start planning for coal phase-down and Just Transition of coal mining districts.


""The situation is changing rapidly, and coal mines are being shut down in an unplanned fashion due to various factors, including unprofitability.""— No Phase-out Plan
Just Transition was included in the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 to ensure that the workers and communities dependent on fossil fuels like coal do not suffer due to the closing of mines and power plants to meet the climate change goals. India has so far not engaged nationally or internationally on coal phase-out and Just Transition because of the country’s high dependence on coal for energy security and industrial growth. But the situation is changing rapidly, and coal mines are being shut down in an unplanned fashion due to various factors, including unprofitability.

In Jharkhand, 50% of mines are closed, and half of the operational mines are unprofitable. Most of the mines have been shut down without proper mine closure and plans for the mining areas’ socio-economic transition. The situation at the district level is even more ominous. In Bokaro, 16 of the 25 mines are already closed, and six of the nine operational mines will exhaust their reserves in the next 10 years. In Jamtara (made famous by the Netflix series of the same name), all five mines are closed. In Ramgarh, a top coal-producing district, 50% of mines are shut, and two-thirds of the operational mines are unprofitable. The situation becomes alarming when one considers the economic dependence of these districts on coal.


""In Jharkhand, 50% of mines are closed; In Bokaro, 16 of the 25 mines are closed; In Jamtara, all five mines are closed""— Rapid Scale Down
Take the case of Ramgarh. Coal mining and coal-dependent industries contribute about 40% of the district’s GDP. Furthermore, one-fourth of the households depend directly on the coal industry for income, mostly informal workers. Therefore, the unplanned closing of mines has real implications on the lives and livelihoods of workers and local communities. The irony is these districts suffered ‘resource curse’ and environmental degradation due to coal mining and are now suffering economically because of its unplanned closure.

But this need not be the case. Experiences worldwide show that Just Transition can be a win-win for the environment and the economy if planned and managed well. A similar effort can be made in India to close coal mines over the next two-three decades and transition coal-dependent districts to a non-coal economy. The good news is that opportunities exist for such a transition planning to start immediately.


""70% of CIL’s mines are loss-making. It can close these and use the additional profits to implement Just Transition in mining areas.""— A Way Out
About 70% of CIL’s mines are loss-making. Many of these mines are losing more than Rs 1,000 per tonne of coal production (coal price in India is about Rs 3,000 per tonne). These mines (more than 170 in numbers) produce less than 10% of coal, employ about 40-45% of CIL’s workforce and incur an aggregate loss of Rs 16,000 crore per year – about the same as the annual profits of the company. CIL can close these unprofitable mines and use the additional profits to implement Just Transition in these mining areas. Coal cess, which collects about Rs 38,000 crore per year and is used for GST compensation till 2022, can also be used for the socio-economic transition of these mining areas.

All the above can only happen if we accept the inevitability of coal phase-out and put in place a Just Transition policy and planning framework. Just Transition is imperative for India. If we do not start planning for a post-coal future now, our coal-dependent regions and industries will face major disruptions in the coming years.

In the 1,070 MW solar auction, Singapore based Sembcorp Energy and Saudi Arabia based Aljomaih Energy and Water Company won 400MW and 200MW respectively at a tariff of Rs 2.00 per unit. The remaining 470MW was bagged by NTPC at a tariff of Rs 2.01 per unit.

The Solar Energy Corporation of India is the nodal agency through which the renewable energy ministry holds wind and solar power auctions. It confirmed the results of the auction.

The lowest so far had been Rs 2.36 per unit which was reached in an auction (also conducted by SECI) in July. Over 5700 MW of bids were received for the 1070 MW tender.

This tender may have received an encouraging response because Rajasthan distribution companies have agreed to purchase the power. “The usual offtake uncertainty is not there,” Vinay Rustagi, Managing Director of renewable energy consultancy firm Bridge To India told ET earlier.

The ministry has slowly been moving away from conducting auctions for plain solar and wind projects. The enthusiastic response for this tender could be attributed to the fact that developers prefer to participate in plain vanilla auctions over hybrid and storage based ones. “There is a stronger preference for (plain) solar tenders because of technical and execution simplicity,” he said."

Aggregates are commonly used in civil engineering projects to stabilise terrain. 

 ""NTPC Ltd has successfully developed geo-polymer coarse aggregate from fly ash. The development will help in replacing natural aggregates, reducing the impact on environment,"" a company statement said. 

 The NTPC's research project on production of geo-polymer coarse aggregates from fly ash has met the statutory parameters of Indian standards and was confirmed by the National Council for Cement and Building Materials (NCCBM). 

 The NTPC has successfully developed geo-polymer coarse aggregates as a replacement to natural aggregates. 

 The technical parameters as per Indian standards for its suitability to use in concrete works were tested by the NCCBM, Hyderabad and the results are in acceptable range. 

 The development is the NTPC's R&D achievement in expanding the horizon in ash utilisation. 

 India's demand for these aggregates touches close to 2,000 million metric tonnes mark every year. 

 The aggregate developed by the NTPC from fly ash will help in meeting the demand to a great extent and also reduce the impact on environment caused by natural aggregates which require quarrying of natural stone. 

 In India, every year, approximately 258 million tonnes of ash is produced by the coal-fired thermal power plants. 

 Out of this, around 78 per cent of the ash is utilised and the balance remains unutilised in ash dykes. 

 The NTPC is exploring alternate ways to utilise the remaining ash which includes the current research project to generate aggregates using more than 90 per cent ash. 

 The geo-polymer aggregates find its extensive usage in construction industry turning the ash eco-friendly. 

 These aggregates are extremely environment friendly and do not require any cement for application in concrete where the fly ash based Geo-polymer mortar acts as the binding agent. 

 The geo-polymer aggregate will help in reducing carbon emission and has great potential for reduction of water consumption."

Investment RationaleThe brokerage expects NTPC’s standalone regulated equity to increase at a strong CAGR of 9.8% over FY20-23E to Rs800bn. Profit growth will be driven by the speedy conversion of its CWIP into commercial assets, which would begin yielding high RoE. It has marginally revised estimates to factor in a change in project mix as per the revised commissioning targets. Accordingly, it has marginally revised TP to Rs125 from Rs122 and maintains positive stance on NTPC due to attractive valuations of 0.7x FY22E P/B, risk-averse regulatory business model and a dividend yield of 5%-6%. Key risks include rising receivables and delay in meeting its project commissioning targets.

NTPC,"Nov 02, 2020, 10:03 PM IST",NTPC Q2 takeaways: Profit beats forecasts; buyback plans,"MUMBAI: State-run power producer NTPC posted better-than-expected September quarter earnings, on the back of exceptional gains and higher revenues. The highlight of the earnings announcement was the Rs 2,275 crore buyback plan.

While the stock has been an underperformer, and has already shed one-fourth of its value year-to-date, it has seen traction in recent times on the back of hopes of a buyback. The stock is up 5.3 per cent over the last one month. Here are key takeaways from NTPC’s Q2 results:


Profits riseNTPC posted 7.43 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth in net profit at Rs 3,504 crore for the quarter ended September on account of exceptional gains of Rs 560.43 crore. Analysts in an ET Now poll had projected the figure at Rs 3,200 crore.


Revenues inch upThe company’s revenue from operations rose 8.40 per cent to Rs 24,677.14 crore.


Buyback announcedNTPC said the board has approved buyback of up to 19.78 crore equity shares at a price of Rs 115. NTPC has fixed November 13 as the record date for the purpose of ascertaining the eligibility of shareholders for buyback of equity shares.


Impact from government’s relief to consumersUnder the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat Special Economic and Comprehensive Package, the company had to allow a rebate of 20-25 per cent on capacity charges during the lockdown period, and has allowed Rs 1,363 crore under the same for FY21, which is disclosed as an exceptional item."
NTPC,"Nov 02, 2020, 07:50 PM IST",IOC says no plan for share buyback as of now,"New Delhi: State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), India's top oil company, has no plans to buyback shares as of now but will consider if there is a mandate, its Director (Finance) Sandeep Kumar Gupta said on Monday. Chasing a record Rs 2.1 lakh crore target from disinvestment proceeds, the government has asked over half a dozen cash-rich PSUs to repurchase shares to help shore up its finances amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

On a conference call with analysts and investors, Gupta said the company hasn't been asked by the government, its majority owner, to do a buyback. 

""We don't have any immediate plans for a share buyback,"" he said. 

Analysts said the government appetite for buyback in IOC is low because its holding in the company is at about 51.5 per cent. The government wants to retain at least 51 per cent stake in strategic PSUs such as IOC. 

The government is reportedly planning to ask Coal India Ltd, electricity generator NTPC Ltd, miner NMDC Ltd, MOIL Ltd, KIOCL Ltd, and Engineers India Ltd to buy back shares this year. The government, being the largest shareholder in these companies, will benefit from the transactions by tendering the equity it holds in return for cash. 

This will help the government access part of the more than Rs 40,000 crore of cash hoard with the companies as of March 31, at a time it has struggled to meet its target of raising money from tax and sale of state assets. So far the government has raised less than 3 per cent of the Rs 2.1 lakh crore disinvestment target. 

Gupta said the IOC board will consider share buyback if asked. 

He went on to add that the share buyback, if any, won't impact its capex plans for fiscal year to March 31, 2021. 

Despite a slow first quarter due to coronavirus lockdown, IOC is hoping to meet its about Rs 22,000 crore capital expenditure target for 2020-21. 

The government has been pushing state-owned companies to increase their capital expenditure as it looks to revive an economy seen contracting by up to 10 per cent in the current fiscal. 

Capital expenditure by PSUs is a critical driver of economic growth and needs to be scaled up for this year as well as next. 

Gupta said IOC is planning to expedite projects on drawing board to boost capex spend. 

However, only projects based on strong viability will be taken in future as the company assess demand destruction pandemic and the transition in energy sector it has forced. 

He said FY2022 capex won't be less than FY2021 target. 

IOC, the nation's biggest fuel retailers, plans to add 2,400 petrol pumps in FY2021, of which 994 stations have already been commissioned. 

""We want to add 2,000-2,500 retail outlets every year"" to maintain the leadership position, he said. 

Gupta said fuel demand is bouncing back fast on the back of festival season with petrol and diesel consumption back to pre-COVID levels already. 

This has seen refineries improve operating run rate, he said adding IOC refineries were running at 95 per cent of the capacity. 

Company's crude oil and petroleum product inventories are at optimal levels now, he said adding the company was holding 9 million tonnes of crude inventory and 8.4 million tonnes of petroleum product stocks."

Infosys,"Dec 09, 2020, 08:55 AM IST",Cloudtail supplies hit after Haryana GST registration suspension,"A brief yet major supply disruption was caused to Cloudtail India, one of the largest retailers on Amazon India platform, following the suspension of its goods and service tax registration for Haryana, a warehousing hub for Cloudtail, on Monday, two people in the know said. 

The tax authorities finally revoked the suspension on Tuesday afternoon, after more than 20 hours of confusion among scores of Cloudtail vendors who were not able to generate e-way bills to send their supplies to Cloudtail warehouses in Haryana, the sources said. 

“We would like to reiterate that Cloudtail's Haryana GST registration is current and valid. We continue to operate in adherence to all applicable GST requirements,” a Cloudtail spokesperson said without specifying why the GST disruption happened in the first place. 

According to a tax official, the company’s monthly GST returns were in order, therefore the suspension could have been due to either an outstanding demand that was not complied with by the company, or an additional input tax credit availed which was not meant to be taken.




The disruption is seen as a setback to the online retailer, especially at a time when ecommerce companies are working overtime to fulfil surging demands as millions of Indians feel safer to stay at home and order everything from food to clothes online rather than venturing out to malls and high streets amid the pandemic. 

As per provisions in law, GST registration can be cancelled if a company has not filed returns for six months, for taking extra input tax credit on the back of fake invoices or bills and therefore taking wrongful tax exemption, or for not having started business operations after six months of taking GST registration.

Some experts felt the sudden suspension of GST registration was not fair. “Power to suspend tax registration should be exercised with extreme caution,” said Harpreet Singh, indirect tax partner at KPMG India. “Internationally, such stringent steps are taken only against taxpayers who are regular defaulters and have proven track record of fraud, mala fide or wilful misstatements.”

Whatever may be the reason for tax authorities’ move, experts said it cannot be just wished away for a large company like Cloudtail that had reported a 25% 
jump in revenues for 2018-19 at Rs 8,945 crore along with a profit of Rs 29.4 crore, according to regulatory filings.


Its numbers for 2019-20 are not available in public domain.
In Haryana, Cloudtail operates fulfilment centres in Gurgaon, Jamalpur, Mewat and Sonipat. 

“Cloudtail's case is the first big instance of GST registration getting suspended after the relaxation period given due to Covid-19 pandemic got over,” said Rajat Mohan, senior partner at chartered accountants firm AMRG Associates.

MS Mani, tax partner at Deloitte India, said, “Since GST is a transaction-based tax, any disruptions in the ability to issue e-way bills, invoices, etc. leads to major business issues. Hence it is essential to formulate safeguards to protect revenue concerns without any business disruptions.”

The suspension of GST registration sparked some confusions among Cloudtail vendors, many whom approached the Bengaluru-based vendor for answers. 

“Haryana is a very big geography and is one of the largest hubs for Cloudtail in terms of number of orders and the value of orders place from that state,” one of the large suppliers to Cloudtail told ET. 

Another large supplier said, “If somebody is unable to generate the e-way bills, then they (Cloudtail) will not give appointment for deliveries and deliveries could be delayed by one or two days for inbound shipments.” 

Cloudtail is owned by Prione Business Services, a joint venture between Amazon and Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy’s Catamaran Ventures. It was in the news in 2018 after India amended its foreign direct investment rules for ecommerce marketplaces and the joint venture had to change its shareholding structure to stay compliant with the changed norms. Amazon had reduced its stake in Prione from 49% to 24% in February 2019 as part of this exercise."

Factors driving markets


AstraZeneca vaccine faces questions: Efficacy of the vaccine is now facing more intense scrutiny, which experts say could delay its approval. Several scientists have raised doubts about the robustness of results showing the shot was 90 per cent effective in a sub-group of trial participants who, by error initially, received a half dose followed by a full dose.


More stimulus coming?: Raising the prospect for further stimulus, the European Central Bank's chief economist warned that tolerating ""a longer phase of even lower inflation"" would hurt consumption and investment.


Trump all but concedes: Trump said on Thursday he will leave the White House if the Electoral College votes for Biden, the closest he has come to conceding the Nov. 3 election, even as he repeated his unfounded claims of massive voter fraud.

“The resistance level for the Nifty is at 13,050 and if we can cross that, we could head to 13,200 by next week. A strong support lies at 12,800 and thereafter at 12,500.

“After a long time traders were struck by nervousness on Wednesday when the Nifty broke down over 200 points from the high. The support of 12,800 has still not been violated and hence traders can continue holding their positions with a trailing stop loss. If we break 12,800, we could drop further to 12,500.

“As we get clarity on vaccine or clarity on a definite time frame for this virus to end or mitigate in terms of its negative impact, we are seeing Covid losers or the good companies in other sectors — cyclicals, etc, now bounce back very quickly,” said Hong Kong-based Chadha in an interview with ET.

“You will see a rotation from names which have done well and IT which has done well will take a breather for probably the next three or six months. Reliance which has done well will take a breather for three or six months. The Covid losers, which are industrials and cyclicals or the banks in India which are still below their February levels would take this market up,” said Chadha.

Indian markets have rallied more than 70% from their March lows. Reliance Industries has been the biggest contributor to the market rally followed by Infosys, HDFC Bank, TCS and Kotak Mahindra Bank.

While some banks have rallied sharply, overall, the sector underperformed during the market rally since March. However, the better-than-expected September quarter earnings coupled with attractive valuations have made investors stock up on banking stocks.

“That is the most attractive sector for us from a six to nine months perspective. We have been positively surprised by the results in the September quarter whereas these companies have given a positive surprise on lower than expected delinquencies etc.,” he said.

Chadha, who has been with Mirae Asset Global since 2006, said that within emerging markets the bias is in favour of South Korea and India as they have been negatively impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. 

“India would be our biggest overweight. Within the region, the two markets which we like are South Korea and India in terms of our overweight,” said Chadha. “Both these markets have reasonable upside on valuations and the growth recovery,” said Chadha. He believes there will be more fiscal support from governments in the Eurozone and the US going ahead.

With eyes on economic recovery bets, Chadha is also bullish on the real estate sector that currently has the backing of some positive factors such as better affordability, and low interest rates.

“Our channel checks with people on the ground have also indicated a sizable interest in buying a new house etc. The sector is under-represented in benchmarks,” said Chadha. “There is a solid backdrop for the sector to grow from here. As the economy recovers, this is a good reflation proxy,” he said."

Britannia Inds.,"Oct 23, 2020, 02:19 PM IST",The consumer returns! Discretionary demand back with a bang,"NEW DELHI: Biscuit maker Britannia Industries’ September quarter numbers had disappointing signals on consumer behaviour, but other data points are telling a different story: demand is shifting from staples to discretionary.

Britannia reported low double-digit profit growth for the September quarter when investors were expecting the number to be much stronger on the back of a 27 per cent sales growth in the Covid-hit June quarter.

On the day Britannia released its earnings, one news portal reported a big jump in iPhone demand at Amazon's Great Indian Festival, where one-day’s sales exceeded the total volume of the whole of last year.

This suggested a strong rebound in discretionary demand.

As the economy gradually opened up from the lockdown since June, consumers have stopped stocking up FMCG goods and the tailwind has started weakening. On the other hand, discretionary demand, in the form of pent-up buying, seems to be picking up, said analysts.

""Consumer behaviour patterns are changing every day. People have started eating out and are snacking outside their homes. All that has started off. People have gotten bored sitting at home and doing nothing. They have started to venture out. Things are moving to about 60-65 per cent normalcy, I would say. But it will take a little more time as Covid-19 is not going away in a hurry,"" Britannia Industries Managing Director Varun Berry told ETNOW.

The biscuit maker reported 10 per cent volume growth for September quarter compared with 22 per cent expansion reported for June quarter. Volume growth stood in the 0-3 per cent range in the previous four quarters.

An increase in discretionary spend suggests the economy is coming back to normal. Passenger car sales have jumped 26 per cent in September while two-wheeler sales climbed 11.64 per cent.

“India’s macro indicators show a steady upturn, as the economy opens up further. Soft indicators such as passenger vehicle sales and PMI data suggest a turnaround, while India’s merchandise exports have entered the positive territory for the first time in seven months, growing at 5.3 per cent. GST collections grew 3.9 per cent,"" Nirmal Bang said in a note.

E-commerce giant Flipkart, which mainly sells white goods and apparels, said it recorded 66 crore visits on its website and 110 order placements per second in its Big Billion Days sales.

Manish Tiwary, Vice President of e-commerce giant Amazon India, told ET NOW that the first 48 hours of its annual Great Indian Festival sales turned out to be the biggest ever for an India unit in terms of value and units sold.

The online sales started on October 16 for Prime members.

“There is a catching up of a lot of pent-up demand. This whole demand would go on beyond the festive season,"" said Nischal Maheshwari of Centrum Broking.

Food delivery aggregators Zomato and Swiggy have reported 2-3 per cent month-on-month decline in desktop and mobile web traffic. Grocery delivery players Grofers, Jio-Mart and BigBasket have seen 17-29 per cent month-on-month drop in traffic, suggests JM Financial.

“With the unlocking, the tailwinds from in-home consumption seem to be declining,” brokerage Emkay Global said in a note.

Emkay still feels Britannia offers a healthy growth outlook, given its strong portfolio expansion and execution, along with improved demand trends in rural areas.

The FMCG firm said its consolidated revenue was up 12.1 per cent at Rs 3,419.11 crore from 3,048.84 crore in the year-ago quarter. Consolidated profit rose 23 per cent to Rs 495.20 crore compared with Rs 405.37 crore profit reported for the same quarter a year ago.

Maheshwari of Centrum Broking said the return of spend has something to do with fatigue as people have been waiting to do stuff, and as comfort levels grow, they are moving out.

“Actually demand is catching up for white goods and two-wheeler players. Two-wheelers are growing, partially due to individual travel and avoidance of public transport. In the case of white goods, people staying back at home are finding that they need more stuff than what they would have done earlier because of domestic help. We need to see this beyond the current festive season and believe we are back on track,"" he said."

Wall Street's main indexes dipped in choppy trading on Wednesday as investors waited for progress in ongoing negotiations related to the coronavirus stimulus package. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 81.54 points, or 0.29%, at 28,227.25, the S&P 500 was down 7.69 points, or 0.22%, at 3,435.43, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 31.46 points, or 0.27%, at 11,485.04.


European shares fall as healthcare, construction sectors dragEuropean shares fell for a third straight session on Wednesday, as losses in healthcare and construction stocks countered a lift from encouraging earnings from consumer giant Nestle and telecoms equipment maker Ericsson. The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 1.0%, in sharp contrast to Asian markets and Wall Street futures that steadied on hopes of a fresh U.S. stimulus package.


Tech View: 12,000 key level to watch for NiftyNifty50 on Wednesday witnessed a sharp recovery. According to market experts, some short covering helped the 50-share index pare its intraday losses. Commenting on the huge swing during the day, Milan Vaishnav, Consulting Technical Analyst and Founder, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory, said, “The strike of 12,000 continued to hold the maximum concentration of Call OI despite the market moving past that level briefly. This led to profit-taking from a higher level.” He further added that the formation of the long lower shadow near the crucial resistance point of 12,000 reinforces the belief that the level is a key resistance point for the market.

In the previous quarter, the company had more than doubled their botomoline, while during the September quarter, too, its performance was at par with the Street expectations.


Here are key takeaways from the Q2 numbers of the cookie maker:
How much did the company earn?Britannia Industries said its net profit stood at Rs 495.20 crore, up 23 per cent while sales grew 12.1 per cent to Rs 3,419.11 crore. Analysts in an ET Now poll had projected the company to report a net profit of Rs 498 crore.


How was the operating profit?
Multiple measures sequentially helped the company sustain the shape of its business and record a 390 bps increase in operating profit during the quarter versus last year. “We sustained a large part of the efficiency gains that we witnessed in the previous quarter viz., supply chain efficiencies, reduction in wastages and fixed costs leverage,” the management said.


How did inflation impact the company?
The costs for the company were stable. The total expenditure for the company was Rs 2,822.02 crore, up about Rs 200 crore, which was in line with the revenue growth that the company delivered.

“On the cost front, we witnessed moderate inflation in the prices of key raw materials and expect the prices to be stable going forward given the positive outlook on monsoon and harvest,” the company said in a statement. 


What is the outlook on future growth?The company said it is keeping a close watch on macro-economic factors, changes in laws, evolving consumer behaviour and is framing medium-term strategy laying out scenarios to deal with this dynamic environment. We are confident of performing well in these tough times with the agility in our action and passion of the team, Britannia added.


Management take
“In this quarter, we got our full range of products to the market, focussed on efficiency in distribution, followed continuous replenishment system of distribution, improved the health of our distributors and inched closer to normalcy in advertising and promotions. The nimble culture and the hard work put in by the team helped deliver a resilient performance in these challenging times. All the adjacent businesses, too, delivered a healthy profitable growth,” said Varun Berry, Managing Director, Britannia. 


Analyst take
“I think Britannia looks pretty decent [in the FMCG space]. They have done some very good launches in non-biscuits, which are wafers and salted snacks that are shaping up well. Also, they have done very well on the premium segment in cookies. So, in biscuits there are plain biscuits, cream biscuits and you have the premium cookies. So not only have they done new launches, they have also launched the smaller sizes,” said Gurmeet Chadha of Complete Circle Consultants


Valuation
Similar to its peers, the company commands rich valuations. At Rs 3,778.80 per share, it trades at 51.55 times its earnings and 21 times its book value. The return on equity (RoE) stands at 40.94."
Britannia Inds.,"Oct 19, 2020, 08:56 PM IST","Britannia Q2 results: Revenue climbs 9% to Rs 3,399 crore","Bengaluru: Britannia Industries on Monday posted a 6% fall in standalone net profit for the second quarter from a year earlier when a lower tax outgo had boosted its performance, even as revenue rose 9%.

The maker of Good Day and Tiger biscuits said distribution services improved with relaxation of lockdown, but the situation would take time to normalise.

The company posted a net profit of Rs 462 crore on revenue of Rs 3,299 crore for the quarter ended September 30.

“In this quarter, we got our full range of products to the market, focussed on efficiency in distribution, followed continuous replenishment system of distribution, improved the health of our distributors and inched closer to normalcy in advertisement and promotions,” managing director Varun Berry said in a stock exchange filing.

The cookie maker expects raw material prices to be stable, helped by good monsoon and harvest. Supply chain efficiencies, reduction in wastage and fixed costs leverage helped it increase operating profit by 3.9 percentage points in the past quarter.

“Britannia’s Q2FY21 performance was slightly lower than our as well as Street expectation,” said Kaustubh Pawaskar of Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, noting that growth normalised in the second quarter due to easing of lockdown regulations.

“High single-digit to low double-digit volume growth is much better than pre-Covid level volume growth of low single digit. The OPM (operating profit margin) continues to expand substantially led by benign input prices and operating efficiencies. Better monsoon and higher agri production would help raw material prices to remain stable in the coming quarters,” added Pawaskar.

In the regulatory filing, Britannia said it was framing a medium-term strategy by keeping a close watch on macroeconomic factors, changes in laws and evolving consumer behaviour post-lockdown.

The Wadia-owned company had posted eight-year high sales growth during the pandemic quarter ended June, driven by at-home consumption and stockpiling but had said this expansion was difficult to maintain. The company had said net profit rose to Rs 516 crore from Rs 250 crore in the year earlier in the fiscal first quarter, when sales increased 25% to Rs 3,307.21 crore.

The lockdown during the first quarter hurt most segments but was good for companies such as Britannia, analysts had said. Families were confined to their homes even before the government imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 25 because of the Covid-19 outbreak, leading to pantry stocking. During the early part of the shutdown, purchases were confined to essentials, including the biscuits, bread and dairy products that the company makes."

“We are working continuously to drive in investment in the state for a holistic development while ensuring employment opportunities for our people,” Dr. Neeraj Mittal, IAS, MD and CEO of the guidance - industries department said, in a press statement. 

According to the Wadia-owned company, Tamil Nadu is one the company’s biggest and diversified markets for growth. 

“It is the most diversified market and we have over the years invested towards strengthening our foothold in the state. We will continue to balance growth across key markets as we look to further deepen our reach in the country,” said Varun Berry, managing director of Britannia Industries, adding, “We are also looking at an overall capex of about Rs 700 crore to set up new facilities in Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Bihar, while also expanding manufacturing capabilities of our existing plants in Maharashtra and Odisha.”

In an investor’s call in July, Britannia had said it will invest Rs 700 crore to open more factories as the demand for packaged food including biscuits had exceeded its production capacity especially as rural markets outpaced urban sales.

Britannia Industries Ltd allegedly violated Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements Regulations (LODR).

Sebi agreed to settle proposed adjudication proceedings in the case pertaining to violation of LODR norms after it was approached by Britannia Industries with a plea under the settlement regulations ""without admitting or denying the findings of fact and conclusion of law"".

In a settlement order passed on Thursday, Sebi said it has disposed of the adjudication proceedings initiated against the applicant (Britannia Industries).

The case pertains to Sujit Kumar Gupta who held certain shares of Britannia Industries and died in 1985.

Britannia Industries had forwarded a letter received from the legal heir of Gupta to its registrar and transfer agent, Sharepro Services (I) Pvt Ltd, wherein information about the shares held in the name of Gupta was requested.

Subsequently, Sharepro received a letter from Balram Mukheijee, enclosing a document, purportedly a court order passed in 1985, which said he was entitled to certain shares held by Gupta. Thereafter, 33,750 shares were transferred to Balram in terms of the court order.

Britannia was also a party to the purported suit filed by Balram, the order noted.

The investigation conducted by Sebi revealed that the court order as submitted by Balram was a forged document.

Therefore, it was alleged that Britannia Industries did not carry out the required due diligence before giving effect to transmission of shares. The transfers were allegedly approved without proper documents, the settlement order noted.

In addition, Britannia Industries allegedly exhibited negligence in issuance of demand draft.

It was alleged that in spite of being aware of the demise of Gupta, demand draft in favour of 'Sujit Kumar Gupta' was issued upon Britannia's instruction by HDFC Bank, which was subsequently encashed by some other Sujit Kumar Gupta.

However, Britannia Industries, through an application filed in January 2020, proposed to settle the proceedings.

Thereafter, high powered advisory committee of the regulator considered the settlement terms proposed by Britannia and recommended the case for settlement upon payment of Rs 46,21,875.

After approval of the recommendation by the panel of whole time members of Sebi, Britannia Industries remitted the settlement amount in August.

""In view of the acceptance of the settlement terms and receipt of settlement amount as above by Sebi, the instant adjudication proceedings initiated against the Noticee (Britannia Industries).... are disposed of,"" Sebi said.

However, the regulator can restore the proceedings under certain circumstances, which include failure of the firm to comply with the settlement order or if the firm is found to have made untrue disclosures."

The deal involves a stake sale to the bank’s subsidiaries, Axis Capital and Axis Securities as well. 

As per the agreement, Axis Bank’s existing 2% stake in Max Life will increase to 9.9% while Axis Capital and Axis Securities will acquire 2% and 1% stake in the target firm, respectively.

After the first acquisition, either of the Axis entities have the right to increase their shareholding in Max Life by 7% in multiple tranches, taking the aggregate shareholding in the target firm to 19.99%, within 42 months of the first acquisition, according to the notice filed with the CCI. 

“Acquirer 1 (Axis Bank) believes in the long-term prospects of India's under-penetrated life insurance space. Acquirer 1 expects the proposed arrangement with their time-tested life insurance partner of ten years to create significant value for its stakeholders,” the notice said.

While not commenting on the impact to competition, Axis bank said in the filing that there would be vertical overlaps in its business and that of Axis Securities with Max Life in the upstream market for life insurance products in India and the downstream market for distribution of life insurance products in India.

The proposed combination would also be subject to approval from the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).

On Wednesday, Max Life’s parent company, Max Financial Solutions Ltd (MFSL), concluded a swap transaction of Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Company’s (MSI) 20.6% stake in Max Life for a 21.9% stake in MFSL.

Now, it is hovering at record high levels of over 44,500 levels. This shows the index has managed to deliver over 13 per cent CAGR return (without counting dividends) despite some major hiccups like the Kargil War, Global Financial Crisis and change in governments, among others.

“Time spent with high quality businesses is more important than timing the market,” Damani said, adding that India is aspiring to become the third largest economy from a Third World country.

The ace stock-picker said there are lots of opportunities in every sector, including retail, cement and technologies. “Investors who have stayed bullish on this country and invested in high quality businesses have made a fortune,” he said.

This is the third disruption of digital services that HDFC Bank customers have faced in the past two years, causing many of them to vent on social media.

The regulator has sought details behind the data centre outage that meant services on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), ATMs and card channels were unavailable for several hours. 

“The regulator has sought details and the reasons behind the data centre outage. Depending on the report submitted by the bank, an internal RBI team will examine it and take further steps,” one of the persons said. “The concern especially is that three big system blackouts happened within two years despite the bank saying last time it had updated its processes and systems.”

HDFC Bank and RBI didn’t respond to queries. 



RBI Team may Visit Data Centre to Examine Issue
The bank tweeted that services had been restored but customers could still face “intermittent issues as the system stabilises.”

In December last year, the RBI had said a team of experts was examining the breakdown of HDFC Bank’s digital banking channels that occurred early that month, causing millions of customers to be locked out of their net and mobile banking accounts for over 48 hours.

The bank had faced a similar outage on its mobile application in 2018, while launching a new version.

“Most likely an RBI team could also visit the data centre and examine what went wrong, and then suggest measures to be taken,” said an official. “It’s quite surprising that a bank of this size is facing such regular outages.”

One person said the bank had told payment industry partners that the issue pertained to a power outage at one of its major data centres. “If true, it begs to be asked why a bank the size of HDFC doesn’t have a backup power source?” the person said.

As of September 30, the bank had 15,292 ATMs in 2,848 cities. Its customers have 14.9 million credit cards and 33.8 million debit cards, according to RBI data, making it one of the largest transaction banks in the country.

BPCL,"Dec 16, 2020, 05:47 PM IST",Oil companies hike cooking gas price by Rs 50 per cylinder for the second time in a fortnight,"New Delhi: State oil companies have hiked the rates of cooking gas by Rs 50 per cylinder, the second rise in a fortnight, making the fuel dearer by Rs 100.

This is the biggest ever monthly rise for cooking gas in the country, especially at a time most consumers aren’t receiving fuel subsidies. The cumulative price hike for a customer eligible for subsidy in the country has been Rs 197 since June last year.

Cooking gas price has risen to Rs 694 per cylinder in Delhi from Rs 644 in the first fortnight of December and Rs 594 in November. Prices, which vary from state to state, had remained static at Rs 594 a cylinder since July this year.
Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum, and Bharat Petroleum didn’t respond to ET’s query on price hikes and subsidies. But an industry executive said the government hasn’t intimated companies on whether consumers can avail of subsidies after such a steep price hike.

Price hikes were necessitated following a steep rise in crude oil prices in the international market, he said. Cooking gas is derived from crude oil and natural gas.

India also depends on imports to meet domestic LPG demand that has sharply risen in the past few years with the expansion of the consumer base.

Since May, most cooking gas customers have not received subsidies as the combination of international oil price collapse and domestic refill rate increases brought parity between subsidized and market rates. 

In June last year, a subsidized cooking gas cylinder cost Rs 497 in Delhi. Since then, the total price increase has been Rs 197. The subsidy for a customer in Delhi was Rs 240 in June 2019."

The committee which will include officials of the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, investment and public asset management will evaluate the strategy for valuation of the profit-making central public sector enterprise which has not seen interest from global major oil companies.

“The committee will have to see the right direction for getting the proper valuation,” the official said, adding that the decision making will take time.

Another source said that the evaluation will be on the technical aspects and financial bids will be sought later on. “There is time for the financial bids,” he said, asking not to be named.

Vedanta had confirmed its bid for India’s second-largest oil marketing company. ET had reported earlier that private equity fund Apollo Global had also submitted EoI, and that it was likely to partner with a global energy major ahead of the final offer. Think Gas did not respond to queries from ET as of Monday evening.

The government has not specified dates by when it will intimate qualified bidders, and has given interested parties 45 days after submitting bids to put together a consortium.

The government plans to sell its entire holding of 52.98 per cent in BPCL to private investors, as one of the key strategic divestments. The proceeds of this sale, which the government expected to conclude before the end of the financial year, will go towards meeting the ambitious divestment target of Rs 2.1 lakh crore set for FY 2020-21. The government has so far received Rs 6311.64 crore from disinvestment proceeds.

BPCL operates four refineries in Mumbai (Maharashtra), Kochi (Kerala), Bina (Madhya Pradesh) and Numaligarh (Assam) with a combined capacity of 38.3 million tonnes per annum.

The government has carved out BPCL's unit Numaligarh refinery from the stake sale and therefore will remain with the government. Therefore, the new buyer of the company will get 35.3 million tonnes of refining capacity.

Government subsidy will continue to be given to BPCL customers if the new owner chooses to retain the business after three years, the official said.

The firm's cooking gas LPG customers will be transferred to other state-owned firms, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), in case the new owner does not want to continue with such a business, the official added.

The government is keen to continue providing subsidy to 7.3 crore domestic cooking gas (LPG) consumers of BPCL even after the firm's privatisation. To resolve the conflict of paying the dole to a private company, it has been decided to transfer the LPG business of the firm into a new strategic business unit (SBU).

The SBU will maintain separate accounts, with records of subsidy received and digitally transferred to user accounts, the official said.

The accounts will be audited to ensure no pilferage, he said.

Subsidy to privatised BPCL will not result in similar payout to other private LPG retailers. ""BPCL is a legacy company and overnight subsidy flow to users cannot be stopped,"" he said.

There will be a three-year lock post-government exit from BPCL, the official said. ""The new owner cannot sell any asset or the SBU for three years. Post three years, the new owner will have a right to decide on retailing the LPG business.""

The government gives 12 cooking gas (LPG) cylinders of 14.2-kg each to households in a year at a subsidised rate. The subsidy this month is about Rs 50 per cylinder, which is directly paid into the bank accounts of the users.

The subsidy is paid in advance and consumers use this to buy LPG refills that are available only at market price from dealers of oil marketing companies -- IOC, BPCL and HPCL.

The moment a refill is bought using the subsidy, another instalment is transferred into the user bank accounts.

On November 27, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had told PTI that government subsidy to BPCL customers will continue after the privatisation of the nation's second-biggest fuel retailers.

""Subsidy on LPG is paid to consumers directly and not to any company. So the ownership of the company that sells LPG is not of any material consequence,"" he had told PTI.

Pradhan had said the LPG subsidy payment is done digitally to all verified customers.

""Since it is paid directly to consumers, it does not matter if the servicing company is public sector or private sector,"" he said. ""LPG subsidy will continue as before to BPCL consumers even after disinvestment.""

The government is selling its entire 53 per cent stake along with management control in BPCL. The new owner will get 15.33 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and 22 per cent of the fuel marketing share.

It also owns 17,355 petrol pumps, 6,159 LPG distributor agencies and 61 out of 256 aviation fuel stations in the country.

BPCL services 7.3 crore out of 28.5 crore LPG consumers in the country.

Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum, GAIL and Petronet LNG will together build the 50 LNG stations in the first phase across ten states. A fuel station will be built every 200-300 km on the golden quadrilateral, which will ultimately have 150 stations. The larger ambition of 1,000 stations will require an investment of Rs 10,000 crore.

ET first reported in January that Indian Oil, GAIL and partners were planning to build a network of LNG fuel stations along the golden quadrilateral expressway.

LNG would be greener and cheaper than diesel and help cut logistics cost, Pradhan said, adding that the target was to convert 10% of the 10 million trucks currently on highways to LNG. This would raise the country's dependence on imported natural gas, which is about half of domestic consumption currently.

Increased import of LNG will decrease India’s import of crude, which would bring down global oil prices, Pradhan said.

Pradhan also sought the support of truck manufacturers to help the LNG plan take off. Without enough domestically-manufactured affordable LNG-using trucks, the fuel stations would be unviable.

India already has lakhs of vehicles using compressed natural gas (CNG) but barely any that uses LNG, which is natural gas supercooled to -162 degree centigrade. Because of its lower energy density and slow refuelling time, CNG is seen as suitable for intra-city transport but not for long-haul drives. LNG contains 2.5 times more energy per unit volume compared to CNG and can fill fast, becoming appropriate for long-distance travel.

In China, LNG-fuelled trucks have been booming in the last few years, mainly helped by the country’s green laws."

They also stated that a major foreign player was among the three-four entities whose EoIs were received by the close of the bidding on November 16.

The other potential investors are foreign funds but their identity was not immediately disclosed.

The government is selling its entire 52.98 per cent stake in India's second largest fuel retailer as part of plans to raise a record Rs 2.1 lakh crore from disinvestment proceeds in 2020-21 (April 2020 to March 2021).

But share price of BPCL has plunged by nearly a fourth since the time the strategic sale was approved in November last year.

At Wednesday's closing price of Rs 383.20 on BSE, the government's 52.98 per cent stake in BPCL is worth just over Rs 44,000 crore. Also, the acquirer would have to make an open offer for buying another 26 per cent stake from the public, which would cost about Rs 21,600 crore.

Vedanta's interest in BPCL stems from its USD 8.67 billion acquisition of oil producer Cairn India nearly a decade back. The company produces oil from oilfields in Rajasthan which are used in refineries such as those operated by BPCL to turn them into petrol, diesel and other fuels.

The government had at the close of bidding stated that ""multiple"" EoIs had been received. It, however, did not reveal the identity of the bidders.

Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which is handling the strategic sale, had tweeted on November 16 that the transaction advisors for the sale of government's 52.98 per cent stake in BPCL have reported receiving ""multiple expressions of interest.""

""The transaction will move to the second stage after scrutiny by TA,"" he had said.

""Strategic disinvestment of BPCL progresses: Now moves to the second stage after multiple expressions of interest have been received,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had also tweeted on the same day.

Neither of them, however, gave the number of bids received or the names of the bidders.

Reliance Industries, which was considered a potential bidder as BPCL would have added 22 per cent fuel market share to its fledgling retail business and made it the nation's number one oil refiner, did not put in a bid.

Saudi Arabian Oil Company (Saudi Aramco), which had been keen to enter the world's fastest-growing fuel market, too did not put in an EoI.

UK's BP plc and Total of France -- which have plans to foray into the Indian fuel market -- had previously ruled themselves out of the BPCL race as they did not want to add oil refining assets when the world was moving away from liquid fuels.

Russian energy giant Rosneft-led Nayara Energy, which operates a 20 million tonnes oil refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat and also has 5,822 petrol pumps, was considered a potential bidder for BPCL but reports last month had indicated it was no longer keen.

Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), which has ambitions for Indian market, too was considered a potential bidder but it was not immediately known if it had put in an EoI.

Sources said transaction advisors will now evaluate the bidders to ascertain if they meet the qualifying criteria and have the financial muscle to do the acquisition.

This process may take two-three weeks, thereafter request for proposal (RFP) will be issued and financial bids sought.

BPCL will give the buyer ownership to 15.33 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and 22 per cent of the fuel marketing share.

BPCL operates four refineries in Mumbai (Maharashtra), Kochi (Kerala), Bina (Madhya Pradesh), and Numaligarh (Assam) with a combined capacity of 38.3 million tonnes per annum, which is 15.3 per cent of India's total refining capacity of 249.8 million tonnes.

While the Numaligarh refinery will be carved out of BPCL and sold to a PSU, the new buyer of the company will get 35.3 million tonnes of refining capacity -- 12 million tonne Mumbai unit, 15.5 million tonne Kochi refinery and 7.8 million tonne Bina unit.

It also owns 17,138 petrol pumps, 6,151 LPG distributor agencies and 61 out of 256 aviation fuel stations in the country.

BPCL is India's second-largest oil marketing company with a standalone domestic sales volume of over 43.10 million tonnes and a market share of 22 per cent during FY20. It is India's sixth largest company by turnover.

Its petrol pumps sell more fuel than the industry average -- BPCL pumps sell 124 kilolitres per month as compared to the industry average of 116, according to the company website.

The firm also has upstream presence with 26 assets in nine countries such as Russia, Brazil, Mozambique, the UAE, Indonesia, Australia, East Timor, Israel and India. It is also making a foray into city gas distribution and has licences for 37 geographical areas (GAs)."

BPCL,"Nov 17, 2020, 10:28 PM IST",Bharat Petroleum confident of meeting 10% ethanol blending target by 2022,"MUMBAI: Bharat Petroleum, which is the national coordinator for ethanol blending by state-owned refiners, is confident of meeting the new government target of blending 10 per cent biofuel with petrol by 2022 with the latest addition of maze to the list of feedstock for the green fuel.

State-run oil marketers are required to blend 10 per cent ethanol in petrol under the national policy on biofuels 2018 by 2022 and 20 per cent by 2030. But so far this has not been moving at scale as surplus sugarcane was not easily available and the blending is only 5 per cent now.

To improve supplies of ethanol-blended petrol, the government has widened the feedstock options. Accordingly, the National Biofuel Coordination Committee of the oil ministry in June allowed the conversion of surplus rice with the Food Corporation into ethanol.

And on Monday (November 16) it also allowed procurement and conversion of the surplus maze into ethanol.

With this, the ethanol production happens from six feedstocks--100 per cent sugarcane juice/sugar syrup/sugar; B-heavy molasses which is sweeter; C-heavy molasses which is mildly sweet; damaged food grain; surplus rice from FCI and surplus maize.

More feedstocks will enable faster procurement and the resultant conversion into ethanol blending, Arun Singh, the director for refineries and marketing at BPCL said, adding surplus rice procurement process from FCI has already started for the 2020-21 cycle and very soon OMCs shall start procuring maze for making ethanol as well.

""We are on our way to achieving ethanol blending target of 10 per cent for petrol by 2022, as additional sources for ethanol have been added now,"" Singh told PTI on Tuesday.

He said currently OMCs are able to blend only 5 per cent or 180 crore litres of ethanol and blamed the lower blending to the shortage of sugarcane last year due to the drought in many regions of key sugarcane producing states. But this year sugar production is expected to be surplus due to the good monsoons, he added.

Singh expects ethanol blending will rise to 7.5-8 per cent or 325-350 crore litres in 2021 and 10 per cent or 370 crore litres in 2022 with more feedstock to choose from.

Of the total blending by 2022, 300-350 crore litres will come from sugarcane, and the rest from non-sugar feedstock like damaged foodgrains, he said, adding 160 crore litres of 180 crore litres come from sugarcane.

The national policy on biofuels 2018 envisages that during a crop year if there is projected over-supply, the surplus can be converted into ethanol. And according to Road and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari, the ethanol economy is a Rs 50,000-crore opportunity if scaled up as planned.

As of April 1, 2020, the FCI has a total of 58.49 million tonne foodgrains in its godowns. Of this, rice is 30.97 million tonne and wheat 27.52 million tonne, which are much higher than the required reserve of about 21 million tonne.

Singh said the estimated annual petrol demand is pegged at 4,600 crore litreÂ this year, which means 450-460 crore litre of ethanol mixing in the December 2020-November 2021 crop cycle."

BPCL,"Nov 13, 2020, 12:58 PM IST",Bombay HC dismisses PIL to challenge the disinvestment of BPCL,"Mumbai: The Bombay High Court has dismissed the Public Interest Litigations (PILs) on Thursday that had challenged the government’s move to disinvest Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) and upheld the decision of the cabinet committee of economic affairs (CCEA) to grant in-principle approval for the disinvestment. 

The division bench of Justice SC Gupte and Justice Madhav Jamdar, while dismissing the four PILs, that had challenged the government’s decision of disinvestment of country’s second-largest public sector oil and gas company observed that the bench had found no ‘merit’ in the petitions. 

“The present governing dispensation is well within its powers to take such decision,” said the court in its 26-page order. “The successive Governments have over the last few years moved in the direction of privatisation. Niti Ayog, which is an expert body of economic policy advisors to the Union, has made a comparative assessment of Central Public Sector Enterprises for strategic disinvestment and identified BPCL as an ideal candidate for it.” 

The four PILs were filed by Federation of all Maharashtra Petrol Dealers Association, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (Refinery) Employees Union, Petroleum Employees Union and an individual Suresh Yashwant Pawar to challenge the November 20, 2019 decision of the government about the disinvestment of its stake in BPCL. 

“No legislative enactment can be challenged either on the ground of undesirability or non-application of mind,” observed the court while dismissing the PILs. “The only available challenges to an enactment by a legislature are on the grounds of vires of the enactment, that is to say, lack of legislative competence on the part of the legislature, and violation of a fundamental right.”

Senior Counsel Navroz Seervai, appearing for the Maharastra Petrol Dealers Association, argued that operators of retail dealership whom the association represents form an integral part of the fuel distribution system in the country and are to that extent stakeholders of BPCL. 

The PILs argued that the original business and undertaking of Burmah Shell, acquired through an Act of parliament and vested in BPCL by notification in pursuance of that Act, cannot be disinvested without specific legislative approval for such disinvestment from the parliament.

“The original acquisition being under an Act of parliament, without the parliament having given its approval for disinvestment either by repeal or amendment of the Burmah Shell Acquisition Act, it is not legally possible for the Union Government to disinvest its shareholding in BPCL,” argued the PILs. 

While additional solicitor general Anil Singh and senior counsel Darius Khambata who appeared for the government and BPCL respectively questioned the locus of this PILs. “There is no merit in the Petitioner’s challenge either to the repealing Act or to the executive decision of in-principle disinvestment by the Union Government,” argued the counsels representing the government. 

“The foregoing material clearly indicates that the impugned disinvestment decision, as of now only at an “in-principle” stage, has already undergone an elaborate process of consideration at the hands of experts and key Government functionaries,” observed the court in its order. “Further steps for actual disinvestment would also involve a thorough consideration and robust checks and balances and further expert inputs.”"

Data from various agencies show that petroleum consumption has reached pre-Covid levels, which should be music to company management’s ears. Moreover, the company said it has also improved refining margin for the half-year ended September despite disruptions in the economy, which is also a good sign.


Here are key takeaways from the Q2 earnings:


How much did the company earn?
BPCL said its consolidated net profit grew by 58.44 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 2,589.52 crore. However, the revenue of the oil marketing player declined 12.29 per cent YoY to Rs 66,331.22 crore.


How much product did the company sell?
The market sales of the corporation for the half-year ended September 2020 was at 16.47 MMT as compared to 21.36 MMT achieved during the half-year ended September 2019. Decrease is mainly in HSD-Retail (-24.91 per cent), MS-Retail (-23.19 per cent), ATF (-72.65 per cent), partly offset by increase in LPG (7.46 per cent).


What was the gross refining margin?
The company managed to improve on this metric but was still far below what companies like Reliance Industries manage. The average gross refining margin (GRM) of the corporation during the half-year ended September 2020 is $3.19 per barrel against $3.10 per barrel for April-September 2019.


What is the update on its voluntary retirement scheme?
The corporation has announced Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) during July 2020 and the company has completed the process of acceptance of applications during the current quarter. An amount of Rs 634.06 crore has been charged to employee benefit expenses towards VRS compensation.


What is the exceptional item?
The company has included an expense of Rs 124.55 crore for share buyback under the Employee Stock Purchase scheme. The firm plans to spend a total of Rs 969 crore for this scheme.

ONGC,"Dec 13, 2020, 03:29 PM IST",HOEC to begin oil from production from B-80 field in April,"NEW DELHI: State-owned ONGC thought the discovery is too small to make economic sense. But Hindustan Oil Exploration Company (HOEC) in two years of taking over the B-18 block has not just discovered more resources but has invested enough to start oil and gas output from April next year. In an interview, HOEC Managing Director P Elango said the company will start producing 8,500 barrels per day of oil and oil equivalent gas from the B-80 block in April next year. 

HOEC in September 2017 won the block in India's first auction round of small discovered fields that the state-owned firms had not developed for a variety of reasons. 

Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) had made an oil discovery in one of the five well it had drilled on the B-80 block that sits in Arabian Sea, off the Mumbai coast, but did not find economics to develop it. ONGC had established a 3,500 barrels per day production from one well. 

""We carried out exploration work and studies, kept cost low and optimised production facilities,"" Elango said. 

HOEC drilled a well in February this year and another in April. Soon, it was able to establish that two wells already drilled on the block can support 5,500-6,000 barrels per day of oil production and 12-15 million cubic feet per day of gas output, he said. 

HOEC kept a tight leash on costs and did process optimisation. 

It converted an old jack-up rig into a mobile offshore process unit (MOPU) to produce and store oil offshore and transfer to refiners. 

""This was cheaper than the option to build a fixed platform on the block,"" he said. 

The MOPU can store 900,000 barrels of oil. Gas, on the other hand, will be delivered to the Gujarat market by tapping into an existing gas pipeline system of ONGC, he said. 

HOEC held 50 per cent stake in the block while the remaining was with Adbhoot Estates. Last week, HOEC increased its stake in the block to 60 per cent. 

""Adbhoot was facing financial problems and so HOEC decided to carry it (or bear its share of cost) till first oil. In return, it will transfer a 10 per cent share to HOEC,"" Elango said. 

The company has also tied up a Rs 150 crore loan. These transactions, he said, will ensure 100 per cent funding of the project with all facilities such as pipelines, installation and commissioning of MOPU and installation of Single Point Mooring/ Floating Storage & Offloading (FSO) unit to commercialize the production of oil and gas by April 2021. 

MOPU and FSO will be 100 per cent owned by the subsidiaries of HOEC, which would also be in revenue mode effective first oil. The loan facility of Rs 150 crore will primarily be used for capital spending and will also leave the company with cash reserves to meet unforeseen contingent costs, if any, during installation, he said. 

""We are convinced that B-80 Block holds a larger resource base and has potential for a longer plateau of production,"" he said.

""We have built a track record on execution and are committed to deliver first oil in April 2021. Once on production, the Block will generate more revenue than the current revenue with increased share of oil."""
ONGC,"Dec 12, 2020, 10:15 AM IST","Larsen & Toubro slated to win Rs 5,500 cr orders, including NPCIL and Chennai Metro Rail jobs","MUMBAI: Larsen & Toubro has emerged the lowest bidder for three orders worth around Rs 5,500 crore, which includes an order from the Nuclear Power Corporation of India for its Kudankulam project, sources close to the development told ET. 

The other two orders are from Chennai Metro Rail (CMRL) and energy major ONGC. Sources said that L&T is likely to officially receive the orders from these clients in the last quarter of 2020-21. L&T declined to comment. 

L&T’s construction arm is the best bidder for the heavy civil infrastructure job to build the main plant for Kudankulam nuclear power plants units 5 and 6 for Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL), the sources said. These units will be built adjacent to units 3 and 4, where L&T is already involved in execution. The Kudankulam nuclear power plant has two operational units and is in the process of building four more, each of capacity 1,000 MWe. The order for the units 5 and 6 are scheduled to be completed in 64 months.

L&T is slated to bag the Chennai Metro Phase II order, which would entail construction of the first 7.95 km elevated section of the Line-4 (Light House – Poonamallee) and the 47 km Line-5 (Madhavaram – Sholinganallur). This line covers nine stations from Power House to Porur Junction. CMRL had invited the bids in July and estimated the project cost at Rs 800 crore. L&T beat two other bidders with a winning bid of Rs 1,035 crore, industry sources said. 

According to sources, L&T Hydrocarbon Engineering has emerged as the lowest bidder for ONGC’s new living quarters and revamp at NQ Complex, one of the oldest assets owned by the company. 

L&T has bucked the industry trend by reporting a robust order inflow in the second half of the fiscal thus far, including its largest order ever worth almost Rs 25,000 crore for a significant part of the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train project. 

A report from Emkay Research said that L&T remains among the top picks for the brokerage given the recent order wins and its existing orderbook. “The awarding activity in Nov’20, in value terms, was down 42% year-on-year and 13% month-on-month, excluding L&T’s order wins. The total awards stood at Rs16,400 crore for Nov’20, compared with a monthly run rate of Rs 28,200 crore for FY19 and Rs15,800 crore since then,” the brokerage said. The report added that adding the value of L&T’s orders, the total order value would be Rs 27,500 crore in the sector."

new guidelines for the discovery of market price, an official order said.

The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas last week notified guidelines for the discovery of market prices for domestically produced natural gas through 
e-
bidding.

The government has since 2017 given pricing freedom for natural gas produced from all fields other than the old fields of state-owned ONGC and Oil India Ltd in nomination blocks.

Firms such as Reliance Industries-BP combine as well as ONGC (for non-nomination blocks) have been auctioning gas to users. They would typically devise a formula and seek bids from users.

They will continue to devise a pricing formula, but will now have to seek bids on the electronic-platform of five pre-selected agencies, the notification said.

The agencies are SBI Capital Markets Ltd, mjunction Services Ltd, RITES, MSTC and CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solution Ltd.

This follows the Union Cabinet in October allowing marketing freedom for blocks where pricing freedom already existed. Alongside, it approved standardised bidding for price discovery.

The companies ""shall design the tender/ bid offer, including the eligibility criteria, bid parameters, evaluation criteria, tender fee, salient terms and conditions of Gas Sales Agreement and any other relevant information etc, with a view to encourage wider participation from prospective buyers, promote competition and maximise the value of natural gas offered,"" it said.

""The existing gas sales agreements, made in connection with contract provisions, would continue till the duration of the agreements/contracts and thereafter subsequent sale of gas shall be subject to these guidelines,"" it added.

Reliance and its partner BP have sold initial 5 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from their second wave of discoveries in the KG-D6 block for five years.

ONGC too has sold initial gas from the neighbouring KG-D5 block.

The two will use the 
new guidelines whenever the existing contracts expire or they have additional quantities of gas to offer.

The order said the companies must ensure at least 21 days' time for bidding.

They have to submit to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) details of the auction such as a list of participants, qualified bidders and selected bidders with their price and quantity allocated.

""The entire proceeding will be conducted by the contractor/producer without any need for the approval of the government,"" the order said. ""The government, however, will have the right to ask for information and intervene if there are reasons to believe that there is foul play.""

bidding portal, it said.

""National oil companies, viz ONZC and OIL shall also follow the guidelines for the discovery of market price of natural gas produced from their nomination fields wherever pricing and marketing freedom has been granted,"" it said.

ONGC,"Dec 07, 2020, 07:02 AM IST",Why are HNIs making a beeline for CPSE ETF,"MUMBAI: Value is emerging from the shadow of growth – especially with the deep pocketed. That’s benefiting the CPSE ETF, which gained 13% in a fortnight.

What’s drawing the rich to a segment of the market that’s rather dull otherwise? There are several factors: Attractive PSU valuations, dividend yields that exceed bank deposit rates, tax arbitrage over direct equity and negligible expense ratio. Average volumes on the NSE have jumped to 14.7 million units in the past one week compared to an average of 3.3 million units in November.

With the market trading at an all-time high, wealth managers are looking for themes with a margin of safety – and are tax efficient, undervalued and help preserve capital.


The CPSE ETF has a dividend yield of 5.55%, PE of 10.68 and a PB of 1.09. By contrast, the Nifty 50 has a PE of 36.46, dividend yield of 1.2 and PB of 3.75.

“Undervaluation of stocks in the CPSE basket and high dividend yield make it an attractive bet,” said Rupesh Bhansali, head (distribution), GEPL Capital. He advised investors to take small bets.

The CPSE ETF is a passive investment scheme that was created to help the government to disinvest some of its stake in selected CPSEs. The government has so far offered units to investors in seven tranches since March 2014. The portfolio has 12 stocks, with four companies - Power Grid, NTPC, Coal India and ONGC – together making up 77% of the portfolio and has an expense ratio of less than 1 paisa. The ETF is down 14% in the last one year while over 3 years, it has lost an annualized 12%.

Analysts believe higher dividends from CPSEs, and the government decision to avoid frequent stake sales could lead to rerating of CPSE stocks. They believe these companies have profitable growth and many of them enjoy monopolies in their line of business.

JM Financial said in a report that even though CPSEs like NTPC and Coal India delivered profit growths of 8% and 3% in the period 2015-2021, their market capitalization eroded by 23% and 66%, largely led by ESG concerns and repeated government stake sales.

“Most stocks are trading at a steep discount to historic valuations as investors are not sure about the government’s direction. In the recent past, representatives from the government have been engaging with fund managers on ways to improve valuations,” said the CIO at a domestic fund house. 

Financial planners are also recommending ultra HNIs to take advantage of the high dividend yield and tax arbitrage through this product.

“From this financial year onwards dividend earned from shares is taxed in line with your tax slab, while if it is earned via the equity mutual fund route you pay only capital gains tax, which is far lower,” said Anup Bhaiya, MD and CEO, Money Honey Financial Services.

Given that the dividend yield of CPSE ETF is higher at 5.5% compared to bank fixed deposits that pay around 5%, and the tax advantage many HNIs are allocating a small portion of their fixed deposit portfolio to the CPSE ETF.

For example, dividends earned by a shareholder in a company will be taxed as per his tax bracket. So, ultra HNIs will pay 42% tax on dividends earned from equity. However, if the same was earned through a mutual fund, it will be added to the NAV and will reflect there. An investor holding such a mutual fund pays only long term tax of 10% if units are sold after a year, and 15% if within, thereby giving a tax arbitrage of up to 32%."

For years, ExxonMobil has sat on the sidelines evaluating business opportunities in the Indian upstream, seeking an easier policy framework and studying geological data for a possible bid for exploration acreage. Last year it tied up with ONGC, India’s largest state-run oil and gas producer, for a possible joint bidding for exploration licenses.

A deal between ExxonMobil and Indian producers may mean a big shift in the government’s policy. In recent years, the emphasis in government’s policy has been on drawing foreign investors to exploration acreages, not big producing fields.

Pradhan told an industry gathering last month that domestic oil and gas companies should function like holding companies, farming out their projects and involving global players with advanced technologies to speed up execution.

ONGC,"Nov 26, 2020, 08:17 PM IST",Oil regulator PNGRB simplifies gas pipeline tariff,"New Delhi: Oil regulator PNGRB has simplified the country's gas pipeline tariff structure to make the fuel more affordable for distant users and to attract investment for building gas infrastructure. The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has notified regulations for a 'unified' tariff structure for over a dozen pipelines that form the National Gas Grid which will lead to a 20-30 per cent rise in transportation charges paid by users near the source but a reduction for consumers in the hinterland. 

 ""Unified tariff shall be determined by the Board in respect of the national gas grid system for each financial year before the start of such financial year,"" it said. 

 Currently, the tariff is levied in proportion to the distance transported - the longer the distance, the higher is the charge. This resulted in consumers away from the coast paying higher charges as compared to those near it. 

 PNGRB has now notified a two-zone tariff structure - Zone-1 will be 300-km from the source of gas (gas field or LNG import terminal) and Zone-II will be beyond that. 

 PNGRB said the tariff for the first tariff zone will be 40 per cent of the tariff for the second zone. 

 This, industry sources said, will lead to an immediate increase in tariff for user industries such as power plants and fertilizer units in Gujarat, which is the landfall for ONGC's offshore gas field as well as houses three gas import terminals. 

 Consumers further away from the source, say in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar, will benefit as they will now pay a lesser tariff. 

 ""The tariff for zone-1 of Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur pipeline (India's main truck line from Gujarat to Uttar Pradesh via Madhya Pradesh) will rise from Rs 20 per million British thermal unit to Rs 26 per mmBtu,"" a source said. 

 The increase will vary from pipeline to pipeline. 

 ""On average, the tariff for zone-1 customers will go up by 20-30 per cent,"" the source said. 

 The pipelines that will be part of the unified tariff plan include state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd-operated Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur (HVJ) and its supplementary Dahej-Vijaipur line and Dahej (in Gujarat) to Uran-Dabhol-Panvel (in Maharashtra) pipeline. 

 Also, the line from Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh to Haldia in West Bengal, Bokaro in Jharkhand and Dhamra in Odisha (called the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga) and Dadri (Uttar Pradesh) to Bawana-Nalga and Dabhol-Bangalore pipeline would be part of it. 

 Reliance Industries' subsidiary operated Shahdol-Phulpur line from its CBM block in Madhya Pradesh to Uttar Pradesh as also its formerly owned East-East pipeline from Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh to Baruch in Gujarat would also be part of the plan. 

 GSPL's proposed Mehsana in Gujarat to Bhatinda in Punjab and onwards to Jammu/Srinagar as well as Mallavaram-Bhopal-Bhilwara-Vijaipur lines would also be part of it. 

 Indian Oil Corp's (IOC) Dadri-Panipat pipeline is also part of the unified structure. 

 Sources said PNGRB will now notify unified tariffs for each of these pipelines. 

 The new tariff structure would help create a single gas market in the country by attracting investment to complete the gas grid and make it more easily accessible. This is part of the government's plan to raise the share of gas in India's energy mix to 15 per cent by 2030 from the current level of about 6.3 per cent to cut its carbon footprint."

It has been consolidating between 28,500 and 29,800 levels since last five sessions and requires followup action to commence the next leg of rally. Now, the index needs to hold above 29,000 level to witness a bounce towards 29,500 and then 29,800 levels, while on the downside, support exists at 28,750 and then 28,500 levels.

Nifty futures closed positive at 12,941 level with 0.54 per cent gains. The trade setup looked positive in IndusInd Bank, Dr Reddy’s Labs, Infosys, TCS, ONGC, Bajaj Finance, Divi’s Lab, Coforge and Hero Moto but weak in HDFC, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, L&T , Bharti Airtel and Titan.

ONGC,"Nov 17, 2020, 07:03 PM IST",ONGC doubles down on spending to make up for lost time due to COVID-19,"India's top oil and gas producer ONGC on Tuesday said its capital expenditure during the current fiscal is likely to be close to the Rs 32,500-crore target as it is doubling efforts to make up for the time lost due to the pandemic. At an investor call, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) Director (Finance) Subhash Kumar said the COVID-19 outbreak and the global restrictions that followed had disrupted the supply chain, hitting its project implementation. 

 Oil and gas exploration and production projects are highly dependent on foreign vendors for the supply of equipment and services. Also, some facilities like rigs are operated by a foreign crew. However, with the gradual resumption of economic activity globally, ONGC is hopeful of making up for the lost time, he said. ""We had in April-May recalibrated capex spending to Rs 26,000 crore on the assumption of a long drawn impact of the pandemic on economic activity. But with things opening up, we will be able to achieve spending of close to Rs 32,000 crore... maybe Rs 29,000 crore to Rs 30,000 crore or Rs 32,000 crore,"" he said. 

 ONGC, India's top oil and gas producer, had budgeted Rs 32,501 crore of capital expenditure for the fiscal to March 2021 (FY21). The company has taken up project work on war footing to meet the capex target. The government is looking at increased public spending to give a boost pandemic-hit economy. It is pushing public sector companies to not just meet the stated capital expenditure targets but even go beyond them. 

 On the capex for the next fiscal, he said the company was in the process of recasting the numbers. 

 ""We had projected Rs 32,000 crore to Rs 33,000 crore capex for the next fiscal. Post Covid, we have to revisit the numbers. Over the next 15-20 days we will have a clearer view,"" he said. 

 Stating that the company continues to lose money at the current government-mandated gas price of USD 1.79 per million British thermal unit, he said the company starts making money only if gas prices are above USD 3.7. 

 The government, he said, has set up a committee to look into the demand for reviewing the current formula which has made gas production an unviable proposition. 

 ONGC, however, is not in favour of either floor or cap on gas prices and there is a need for a balance between both. 

 ""We have now rock bottom prices,"" he said. 

 On the outlook for coming quarters, he said ""the worst is behind and things will improve"". 

 ONGC got USD 28.72 for every barrel of crude oil it sold in the April-June quarter, which improved to USD 41.38 in July-September. 

 ""Things can only get better from here. We anticipate second-half performance will be better,"" he said. 

 Commenting on ONGC's second-quarter earnings, Moody's Investors Service said despite the recent recovery, crude oil prices remain below fiscal 2020 levels (fiscal year ending March 31, 2020). 

 ""We assume oil prices to average USD 45 per barrel in 2021 because of low demand and high inventory levels. As such, earnings from sale of crude oil will remain at or near current levels over this period,"" it said. 

 Earnings from gas sales will decline because the Government of India reduced domestic natural gas prices by 25 per cent from October 2020, it said adding lower gas revenue will not have a significant impact on overall revenue as gas contributes only about 20-25 per cent of upstream revenue. 

 Earnings from the refining segment will recover in subsequent quarters on the back of a recovery in throughput levels. However, it will remain weak compared with previous years because of sustained weakness in refining margins, it said. 

 Capital spending fell by 7 per cent to Rs 19,100 crore during the first six months of fiscal 2021 compared with Rs 20,600 crore in the same period last year. 

 ""We expect capital spending to increase in the subsequent quarters as economic activity rebounds following the easing of lockdowns,"" Moody's said. 

 In addition, shareholder payments are expected to remain in line with historical levels notwithstanding the company's operating performance as the government, which is the largest shareholder in ONGC, relies on dividends from the company as a source of revenue to meet its fiscal deficit target. 

 However, the company has not declared any dividend in the current fiscal year. ""An increase in capital spending and shareholder payments during the current low earnings period could translate into an increase in borrowings creating pressure on the rating,"" Moody's said."
ONGC,"Nov 17, 2020, 05:55 PM IST",Domestic oil and gas producers should function like holding companies: Dharmendra Pradhan,"New Delhi: Domestic oil and gas producers should function like holding companies, farming out their exploration acreages and involving global players with advanced technologies to speed up project execution and run them professionally, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has said.

“Business as usual approach will not work. From day one, it has to be a commercially-viable, technology-friendly model and run professionally,” Pradhan told a gathering of industry executives at a ceremony to give away exploration licenses to the winners in the latest, fifth, round. ONGC and Oil India have won seven and four blocks, respectively, in the latest round.

India has introduced several policy measures in the exploration sector in the last few years but has attracted limited interest from foreign or private players. Domestic oil production has been declining for a decade and the country imports more than 80% of its requirement.

Domestic companies need to increase their execution pace and move at ‘exponential speed’ in managing their exploration projects, Pradhan said. Partnering with technology firms will help everyone including the domestic oil firms as well as the exchequer, he added.

Deeper involvement of information technology, digitalisation and the internet has transformed the oil and gas sector, improving everything from data analysis to production, he said.

Pradhan also suggested that an independent, modern, profit-making body be set up for exploration data management so that all the bidders have access to the relevant information for making an informed investment decision."
ONGC,"Nov 17, 2020, 03:36 PM IST",Indian oil firms need to bring in foreign players to unlock resources:  Dharmendra Pradhan,"NEW DELHI: India's oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan asked exploration companies to consider farming out their acreages to global players with advanced technology to expedite development and raise oil and gas output.

 India, the world's third biggest oil importer and consumer, depends on foreign purchases for over 80% of its oil needs. The nation's oil and gas output has been stagnant for years, forcing it to raise reliance on imports to meet rising fuel demand.

 ""The government will grant petroleum mining lease rights but the companies should consider a farm-out (of a stake) to get global technology players,"" Pradhan said in Hindi.

 Indian exploration companies should work at ""exponential speed"" to unlock resources, Pradhan said at production sharing signing ceremony of 11 oil and blocks by state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp and Oil India Ltd.

 India's exploration licensing rounds have so far seen a lukewarm response from global oil majors, with most of the blocks awarded to local companies, mainly ONGC and Oil India.

 The companies have to reject a ""business as usual approach"" and adopt a professionally-run ""commercially viable and technological friendly"" model to boost output, Pradhan said.

 He urged Indian exploration companies to function like holding firms and share revenue and profit with their new technical and financial partners. This will also boost the nation's resources and add to the federal exchequer, he said."

Speaking at the signing ceremony, 
Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said with the latest bid round, the government has in the last four years awarded 1.56 lakh square kilometre of acreage

for exploring and producing 
oil and gas have in the past led to several slippages in the committed timelines.

""Tell us, if you need more help,"" Pradhan said asking explorers to give suggestions on improving the regulatory environment. ""Business as usual cannot work.""

The minister also wanted the data repository set up by his ministry's upstream nodal agency, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), to be remodelled on lines of the National Geoscience Data Repository (NGDR) of the mines ministry.

He wanted the data repository, which houses geological data of Indian sedimentary basins, to become an independent profit centre.

The NGDR is a public-private initiative

blocks on offer. 
ONGC had walked away with all the seven 
oil and gas 
blocks on offer.

Prior to OALP-V, the government had awarded 94 
blocks in four OALP bid rounds since 2017. These 94 
blocks cover an exploratory area of about 1,36,790 sq km over 16 Indian sedimentary basins.

In the latest bid round, about 19,800 sq km of the area was offered 
for bidding, he said.

At the time of the launch of OALP-V, DGH had stated that the round is expected to ""generate immediate exploration work commitment of around USD 400-450 million"".

Of the 94 
blocks awarded in the first four rounds of OALP, Vedanta has won the maximum at 51. 
Oil India Ltd has got 21 
blocks and

After OALP-V, 
ONGC's tally has gone up to 24 and that of

Eicher Motors,"Dec 07, 2020, 11:55 PM IST","Commercial vehicle sales picking up, likely to regain peak, says VE Commercial Vehicles MD","NEW DELHI: Demand for commercial vehicles – a key indicator of economic activity – has started picking up and the industry is expected to get back on to the growth path in the next financial year, Vinod Aggarwal, managing director of VE Commercial Vehicles, told ET. 

Sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles in the country have declined 58% year on year between April and November, he said. 

“However, demand has improved over the past two months as the trucking industry is picking up,” Aggarwal said. “Going forward, with economic activity expected to better, sentiments are positive. With the possibility of (Covid-19) vaccine, the next financial year should bode much better for industry.”

Replacement demand for medium and heavy commercial vehicles, which had petered out the last three years, is expected to gain pace as economic activity increases and support growth in the segment. 

VE Commercial Vehicles, a joint venture between Volvo Group and Eicher Motors, is a small but significant player with about 5% share in the Indian commercial vehicle market, behind market leader Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra and Ashok Leyland.

While overall, sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles are still likely to decline by 40% in 2020-21, the industry is expected to grow thereafter and regain peak sales of 390,732 units registered in FY19 next fiscal year. 

Sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles had dropped by 42.47% to 224,806 units last fiscal.

Aggarwal said the excess capacity which had been released in the marked on account of a change in axle load norms has been absorbed. And, even though cost of acquisition of commercial vehicles have increased due to the implementation of BSVI emission norms, new trucks deliver higher productivity, and have lower overall cost of ownership, which would make them attractive for buyers, he said. 

VE Commercial Vehicles has invested Rs 350 crore in commissioning a new plant in Bhopal on Saturday to cash in on demand once the market revives. The company has earmarked an additional Rs 150 crore to set up a paint shop at the facility. The new unit will take the company’s total investment in Madhya Pradesh to over Rs 5,000 crore.

“Together with our facilities in Pithampur, we will now have the capacity to produce 130,000 units per annum,” Aggarwal said. “This puts us in a very good position because once the market improves, we will be able to take advantage of this investment and cash in on demand.”

The new manufacturing unit has initial installed capacity to roll out 40,000 units per annum.

With the commissioning of the new facility, Aggarwal said the company is at the close of an investment cycle. It will continue to invest Rs 300-400 crore every year as capex going forward, he said."

However, the sudden drop was largely expected and will cool off the valuations. 

The sudden profit booking came in amid weakness in the Asian markets and increasing nervousness among market participants, as evinced from the sharp rise in volatility indicator. 

The 30-share pack Sensex crashed 694.92 points or 1.56 per cent to 43,828.10. The index tumbled nearly 1,000 points from the day's high which was also the all-time high. NSE Nifty slumped 196.75 points or 1.51 per cent to 12,858.40. 

""The market rally which was led by developments on vaccine and FPI inflows came to a halt today due to profit booking across sectors in the second half of the trading session. While western markets continued its positivity, we can expect profit booking to continue in our domestic market, in the short-term, as the liquidity driven rally can take a pause having reached all-time high on a monthly basis,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. 

Investors lost Rs 2.25 lakh crore during the day as market cap of all BSE-listed firms came down to Rs 172.55 lakh crore.

Eicher Motors,"Nov 19, 2020, 10:18 AM IST","Imitation doesn’t work, Eicher’s Siddhartha Lal to rivals","(This story originally appeared in  on Nov 19, 2020)NEW DELHI: As Royal Enfield (RE) faces competition from the partnership between Hero MotoCorp and Harley-Davidson, as well as a 350cc cruiser launched by Honda (called H'Ness), Siddhartha Lal, MD of Eicher Motors (that controls RE), has made a frontal attack on the challengers. He said ""imitation and trying to copy doesn't work"" and that his company is ""10 steps ahead of the market"".

Lal's company has models such as the 350cc Bullet, Classic & the new Meteor, the 410cc Himalayan and the 650cc Interceptor & Continental GT that dominate the premium-end of the motorcycle category. He said the market is in a habit of sounding the death knell for his brand every time some other company comes up with new products over the last six years.

However, the strength of his products, and RE's premium experiences in sales, dealership walk-ins, marketing and after-sales have kept his brand going strong. ""It surprises me that people are not charting their (own) route and are going for imitation... my view is that imitation and trying to copy doesn't work, it just boosts the original. It's in a way them (challengers) saying that 'we're putting our hands up and we can't do it, and so (we) will copy you',"" Lal told TOI.

While Hero Moto and Harley forged a relationship just a few weeks ago to work together on mid-sized bikes and sales, spares and accessories, Honda Motorcycle and Scooters India (HMSI) had launched the 350cc H'ness in October, which incidentally carries the thump that is one of the most-distinct features of RE bikes. When asked about adopting a 'follower approach' to RE, HMSI officials took pains to emphasise, ""We have a very authentic 'Honda thump'.""

Bajaj Auto has been expanding its premium portfolio with KTM and Triumph, while Mahindra has entered the category with Java and plans to get BSA.

Lal's RE, after struggling for years, has made a remarkable resurgence over the past few years, and has seen a massive surge in sales, making it one of the strongest brands in the lucrative and high-margin premium category. The company, which is not present in the low-margin commuter business (dominated by Hero Moto, TVS, HMSI and Bajaj), has had an almost unchallenged run in the premium cruiser category.

Foreign brands such as Harley and Triumph only helped generate interest in premium motorcycles, but failed to sell in good numbers due to high pricing. RE became the best choice for upgraders from commuter motorcycles, and even for growing list of first-time buyers."

Analysts see 14% upside,"Mumbai: Shares of Eicher Motors rallied 9 per cent to its 52-week high on Friday as analysts turned upbeat on the prospects of the Royal Enfield (RE) maker and ignored the steep decline in September quarter net profit.

Jefferies has maintained a buy rating and raised price target on the stock to Rs 2,900 from Rs 2,500 earlier, as it raised FY21-23 EPS estimates by 4-9 per cent, mainly factoring in higher Royal Enfield (RE) volumes and margins.

Prabhudas Lilladher retained its ‘accumulate’ rating on the stock, and raised its price target to Rs 2,598 from Rs 2,291 earlier, citing RE’s under-penetration in the key motorcycling states, it monopoly for upgrade options in higher-than-300CC segment and a favourable product cycle after a gap of around eight years in the 350cc segment.

While revenue growth has been flat on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, the company has posted a strong revenue growth of 161 per cent sequentially.

Jyoti Roy, DVP and Equity Strategist at Angel Broking, said improvement in performance sequentially has largely been due to improved consumer demand.

“While second quarter numbers have been tepid, the management commentary has been positive as they highlighted that booking numbers have been ahead of pre-Covid levels and the company has a robust order book, which bodes well for growth in the next quarter,” he said."

""ICICI quoted the lowest bid,"" a person familiar with the development said.

Punjab National Bank, the convenor of state level bankers' committee (SLBC), by the virtue of its merger with United Bank of India, did not bid for the project. PNB officials said that neither UBI nor PNB could bid as both were busy in the process of merger.

ICICI Bank,"Dec 08, 2020, 09:08 AM IST",Chanda Kochhar told Videocon's Dhoot to invest in hubby’s company: ED,"(This story originally appeared in  on Dec 08, 2020)MUMBAI: Former head of ICICI Bank Chanda Kochhar had in 2009 told Videocon group chairman V N Dhoot, whose loan applications had been pending with the bank, to invest money in her husband Deepak’s company, said the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in its chargesheet filed recently.

The documents attached to the chargesheet show that in Pacific Capital Service Pvt Ltd (PCSPL), one of the companies belonging to Kochhar, an office boy who served tea was shown as a director and had a stake in the company.

Sharad Mhatre, the office boy, said that he was taking care of Deepak’s father and briefly worked as a driver with the family. He told the ED that he would sign documents on instructions from Deepak without knowing the content.

Dhoot in his statement to the ED said that it would have been detrimental to his interests if he had not agreed to it. Videocon group invested Rs 64 crore ino NuPower Renewable Pvt Ltd (NRPL), a company controlled by Deepak.

The ED alleged that Chanda misused her position in the bank to sanction a loan to Videocon group after violating rules and received kickbacks in the form of investments in her husband’s company, Nu-Power. The ED submitted the chargesheet against Kochhars and Dhoot before a special court on November 4 and annexed these statements to it.

Dhoot told ED that Deepak asked him to invest in his company and insisted that he meet Chanda, who was then heading the ICICI Bank. Officials said that Chanda told Dhoot to “take care of her husband’s interest by putting money in his company”. Dhoot claimed it was because of this that he transferred Rs 64 crore of the Rs 300 crore loan disbursed to his group company by the ICICI Bank.

The ICICI Bank in all had sanctioned Rs 5,393 crore loan to Videocon group companies in different tranches during the tenure of Chanda, of which the principal amount of Rs 2,812 crore turned bad. The collateral kept with the bank was not in proportion to the loan sanctioned, said the ED. The ED alleged that the loan to NuPower was not intended to be returned to Videocon, because a group company, Real Cleantech Pvt Ltd, which was created for holding the proceeds of crime, was allowed a silent death. The company was struck off in 2018, to break the link of returning the NuPower loan money to Videocon group, said ED.

The Videocon group initiated the process to revive Real Cleantech after the ED started to investigate the money laundering case against it in 2019, all to show that money diverted to NuPower was a legitimate investment and returned to the Videocon group.

Deepak has been controlling NuPower since its formation in 2008, through PCSPL, which was formed in 1999. Most directors of PCSPL were Deepak’s relatives or employees."
ICICI Bank,"Dec 08, 2020, 07:44 AM IST","Business improving, fresh loan slippages unlikely: ICICI Bank","Mumbai: ICICI Bank, India’s second-most valued lender after HDFC Bank, told analysts that business is beginning to look up and fresh slippages are unlikely to be significant as the majority of the bad loans had already been identified before the lockdowns began to prevent the Covid-19 pandemic from spreading.

Separately, the lender also told analysts that technical outages are an unfortunate but harsh reality in an increasingly digital banking landscape, Macquarie Capital said in a report that captured the outcome of the management's meeting with analysts. 

ICICI Bank’s comments on system outages follow the recent central bank curbs on further expansion of digital services at HDFC Bank, where web and online services faced some disruptions. Macquarie Capital said that since many of the bad loans had already been accounted for in the previous cycle, the bank is now left with a more resilient corporate portfolio.

“Hence, the pandemic hasn’t affected their portfolio much and they clearly guided for restructured assets to be sub 1%,” said Suresh Ganapathy, associate director, Macquarie Capital, who posted a note on the ICICI Bank analysts’ meet. “They are also seeing renewed optimism in corporate banking and their recent interactions with corporates indicate that some corporates are more optimistic now than they were pre-Covid and this should lead to a revival in capex.”

Steel, cement, and pharma supply chains would be the key sectors driving capex. However, capex will still be initially led by the government and PSUs, Ganapathy added. 

The bank also told analysts that the corporate loan book grew 1.3x in the last two years. 

“As per the management, it would be incorrect to say that growth in the corporate banking loan book has been low as reported numbers also include non-performing loans. In fact, originations (direct + funds raised through DCM division) in the performing corporate loan book grew 1.3x in the last two years,” Ganapathy said in his note. 

On system outages in light of an enhanced share of digital banking, the ICICI Bank management told analysts that banks will try and minimise the probability of such events. It hosted its analyst day to showcase its digital capabilities around each of its business verticals.

 Meanwhile, ICICI Bank is focusing on transforming its role from ‘provider of capital’ to that of a partner providing dealer vendor solutions and reducing working capital cycles. That will help the corporates increase their top-lines and the focus of the bank has been to capture the entire ecosystem through 360-degree banking, Ganapathy said."
ICICI Bank,"Dec 07, 2020, 08:14 PM IST",ICICI Bank opens up its mobile app for customers of rival lenders,"MUMBAI: At a time when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has tightened scrutiny over digital services offered by banks in light of increased instances of outages, private sector lender ICICI Bank has upgraded its mobile app to allow customers of rival banks to avail basic online banking services on its platform. 

The new app, which ICICI Bank claims is a first in the industry, will allow users to link their bank accounts, generate a UPI ID and avail services such as online transactions, opening savings accounts, making investments, applying for loans and credit cards without being an ICICI Bank account holder. 

The lender in a statement said that it aims to “extend the ambit of mobile banking apps which are hitherto restricted to only the customers of the respective banks.”

Anup Bagchi, the executive director at the bank said that the new initiative will allow customers to avail “benefits of banking and payment apps in one single place” instead of having multiple such apps on their smartphones.

“In the recent past, we have captured two user insights while interacting with them. One, many of them, who are not our customers, are keen to use iMobile (ICICI Bank App). Two, customers are tired of using multiple apps…Now on, customers of any bank can experience the ease, speed and safety of our mobile banking app,” he added.

The move comes just days after RBI’s temporary sanctions on rival lender HDFC Bank to launch new digital initiatives and source new credit card customers noting instances of multiple mass outages in mobile banking services in recent years, amid intensifying scrutiny by the regulator on technological vulnerabilities in India's banking system.

According to Dilip Asbe, the CEO of National Payments Corp of India, the initiative “will inspire the ecosystem to integrate interoperability on digital platforms...The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is known to provide seamless, secure and convenient payment experience to its users…,” he said."

ICICI Bank,"Dec 01, 2020, 11:13 PM IST",Supreme Court dismisses Chanda Kochhar's plea against termination by ICICI Bank,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed Chanda Kochhar’s plea against her termination from ICICI Bank where she was managing director and chief executive, calling it a “contractual matter” between a private bank and its employee.

Kochhar had resigned from ICICI Bank after she was accused of conflict of interest in a loan deal between the lender and the Videocon Group. But the bank later converted her resignation into “termination”. Kochhar challenged it at the Bombay High Court, arguing that her termination without prior sanction of the central bank was “wrong” and “mala fide”, and when her plea was dismissed, she approached the top court.

On Tuesday, she argued through senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi that top bank employees were a class apart and must be protected from such arbitrary actions. She also argued that the decision of the bank, where she had put in 30-odd years, had affected her reputation.

“You can claim damages if you think that you have been defamed,” a three-judge bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said, while dismissing her appeal against the HC order. “There’s no rocking of the bank or banking systems,” it added.

Rohatgi persisted, saying that the Reserve Bank of India had no jurisdiction to give post-facto approval to the move to terminate Kochhar after three months. He claimed that she had sent in her letter of voluntary resignation in October 2018. 

Her resignation was converted into termination after an internal report submitted by the Srikrishna Commission. “I have not taken part in its proceedings. I don’t have a copy of the report. My termination has nothing to do with that report,” Kochhar claimed in the court.

Rohatgi also argued that the distinction between public and private banks in recent years had blurred and that the huge public funds with private banks gave them an element of public character. 

“Banks can’t say they can hire and fire,” he said. But the bench rejected all his arguments saying: “We are not inclined to interfere.”

Kochhar is also accused of receiving kickbacks through her husband for sanctioning the loans given by ICICI Bank to the Videocon Group, a charge which is being investigated by the CBI. The Enforcement Directorate is separately investigating charges of money laundering against the couple. The Kochhars and Videocon have denied wrongdoing.

The ED had assured the top court that no coercive action would be taken against her for now. Her husband, Deepak Kochhar, has been arrested and is in jail.

At the previous hearing, Rohatgi had insisted that the couple had been completely exonerated by the authorities under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had, however, contested this version, saying that only the attachment of their properties by the ED had been set aside."

Tata Steel,"Dec 08, 2020, 06:53 PM IST",S&P Global revises Tata Steel’s outlook to stable from negative on earnings rebound,"Mumbai: Standard & Poor's (S&P) Global Ratings has revised Tata Steel and its Singapore-based subsidiary ABJA investments’ outlook to stable from negative on the back of solid earnings rebound.

The global rating agency has also affirmed B+ long-term issuer credit ratings on the two companies and the B+ long-term issue rating on the senior unsecured notes issued by ABJA.

“Tata Steel Ltd earnings outlook over the next 12-18 months and recovery from COVID-19 disruptions are stronger than we previously expected…We are therefore revising our outlook on Tata Steel and its subsidiary ABJA Investment Co. Pte. Ltd. to stable from negative,” said S&P Global ratings in a report on Tuesday.

The stable outlook reflects S&P Global’s expectation that Tata Steel's earnings would improve over the next 18 months such that its key financial metrics like its EBITDA interest coverage ratio will remain comfortably above 2.0x--our earlier downgrade trigger, the report said.

“A key factor driving improved near-term profitability for most steel producers is the sharp decline in coking coal prices. Prices are down around 30% year on year, and we expect them to remain soft at least for the next two quarters,” the report said.

Along with lower input costs, domestic steel prices for Tata Steel's Indian operations will also be higher in the second half of fiscal 2021, with a price increase of about Rs 3,000 per ton already implemented in October 2020, the report said.

""Weakness at the European operations has also been lower than we previously expected, thanks to the company's earlier cost reduction initiatives as well as sizable government wage support of about £100 million received in the first half of 2020,” the report said.

S&P also said that debt-to-EBITDA ratio of Tata Steel will likely decline to less than 5 times as of March 2022, from 6.7 times as of March 2020.

“Tata Steel's deleveraging is also supported by free operating cash flow, especially in fiscal 2021...We forecast the company's EBITDA interest coverage will remain well above 2 times our previous downgrade trigger in the next 12-18 months,” the company said.

Tata Steel has adequate headroom at the current rating but high leverage limits further upside.

“Operating risks remain high despite improved sentiment,” the report said, adding that the key risks include volatile steel prices due to the potential economic impact from renewed surges of COVID-19 infections and an increase in input prices, especially coking coal.

The rating agency has not included the SSAB transaction in its base case. However, it views the sale as positive for Tata Steel's credit profile because it could result in meaningful deleveraging.

“We expect the company to maintain adequate liquidity over the next 12-18 months, underpinned by a strong cash position, positive operating outlook, and manageable debt maturities,” the agency said.

As of Sept. 30, 2020, Tata Steel had Rs 178 billion of cash and cash equivalent. In comparison, debt maturities over the next year were only about Rs 18 billion, apart from about Rs 130 billion of short-term debt.

However, the agency also warned that it could lower the rating on Tata Steel if its earnings deteriorate or the company takes on additional debt such that its funds from operations-to-debt ratio declines to less than 6% or if its EBITDA interest coverage falls below 2x."
Tata Steel,"Dec 06, 2020, 01:34 PM IST",India's coal import drops 19% to 117 MT in Apr-Oct this fiscal,"NEW DELHI: India's coal import saw a drop of 18.6 per cent to 116.81 million tonnes (MT) during April-October this fiscal as against the same period a year ago.

India had imported 143.63 MT of coal during the corresponding period of FY 2019-20, according to a provisional compilation by mjunction services, based on monitoring of vessels' positions and data received from shipping companies.

mjunction -- a joint venture between Tata Steel and SAIL -- is a B2B e-commerce company and also publishes research reports on coal and steel verticals.

However, the country's coal import increased to 21.50 MT in October this year as against 18.28 MT in the corresponding month of the previous fiscal, it said.

Of the total import in October 2020, non-coking coal was at 14.46 MT. In October 2019, the import was 13.57 MT. Coking coal import stood at 4.92 MT in October 2020, up from 2.79 MT imported in the same month last fiscal.

During the April-October period this year, the non-coking coal import was at 77.67 MT as compared to 98.73 MT in the same period a year ago.

Coking coal import during April-October was recorded at 23.89 MT, lower than 28.63 MT imported during the same period a year ago.

""The spurt in demand during the festive season coupled with winter restocking led to increased volumes. Also, there was expectation of prices firming up in the international markets due to short-term supply tightness. Overall, however, imports are likely to see significant decline during the year as compared to last fiscal,"" Vinaya Varma, MD and CEO, mjunction services, said."

Investment RationaleThe outlook for its India operations has improved significantly, led by better domestic demand and prices. While EBITDA growth should be strong in 2HFY21, the brokerage forecasts an expansion in working capital and capex to limit FCF growth. It expects Tata Steel Europe’s EBITDA to turn positive in 2HFY21. While the potential sale of the company’s profitable operations in the Netherlands could lower debt, retention of the loss-making UK business would remain an overhang on the stock. With TATA already on track to meet its debt reduction plan of USD1b for FY21, concerns on leverage are abating. It expects net debt to decline by INR150b (INR131/share) to INR921b over FY20-22E. At the CMP, the stock trades at 5.8x FY22E EV/EBITDA. It maintains neutral with a TP of INR604/share based on FY22E EV/EBITDA of 6x for its Indian operations and 5x for Europe.

Tata Steel,"Nov 24, 2020, 11:04 PM IST",EU steel market’s demand recovery to boost Tata Steel Europe's earnings in H2 of FY21,"Mumbai: For Asia’s oldest maker of the primary infrastructure alloy, Tata Steel, Europe has suddenly become very crucial, as the old continent shows distinct signs of stirring back to life despite isolated lockdowns.

Top steelmakers in Europe have raised prices of carbon steel – something that would have a material impact on their performances. So much so that Tata Steel Europe may post positive earnings in Q3 and Q4, say analysts.

“Europe is witnessing price hikes in carbon steel…which if it sustains for longer will lead to earnings upgrades for companies including Tata Steel,” said global brokerage firm, Morgan Stanley in its recent report.

ArcelorMittal has raised its EU HRC spot prices by euro 600 per tonne from around euro 540 per tonne. If accepted, this would take the European spreads to a record level of around $400 per tonne vs the historical average of $244 per tonne, other steelmakers will follow suit.

“Most of the European peers like ArcelorMittal, SSAB and Voestalpine have indicated a probable pick up in demand in the Dec 2020 quarter on a sequential basis with potential for better spreads,” said Morgan Stanley’s report

Tata Steel did not comment.

Along with a strong demand revival, a structural shortage of steel and lower solid fuel prices are also helping boost profit performance. 

“While capacities idled in Q1FY21 are gradually restarting, we expect supply constraints to sustain in Q3FY21…lending support to prices,” said Amit Dixit, research analyst, Edelweiss Institutional Equities.

Tata Steel Europe could surprise the street in Q3 and Q4. Spreads have been increasing, and they have been booking contracts since June, and these price increases will boost their Ebitda, added Dixit.

Morgan Stanley has said that a sustained period of wider spreads would benefit European operations and limit cash losses.

Tata Steel reported a consolidated net profit after three quarters at Rs 1,665.07 crore for the September quarter, and Tata Steel Europe reported a loss of Rs 462.07 crore during the same quarter.

 “We expect the company’s European operations to post a positive Ebitda in Q3,” said Amit Murarka, research analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Tata Steel recently announced holding talks with Sweden-based steelmaker, SSAB, for the potential sale of Tata Steel’s Netherlands business, including the Ijmuiden Steelworks. While the deal is still at an early stage, analysts believe that with positive demand revival in Europe, the company will get a good deal on the sale.

“The recovery in demand in the EU might result in the company getting a good price on the deal, but the deal is still at a very early stage of completing the due diligence process,” added Murarka.

 The recovery will come in as a breather for Tata Steel’s struggling operations at Port Talbot in the UK. While the company has planned to sell its profit-making Netherlands business, it is looking for some support from the UK government for its Port Talbot plant.

“This is positive for Tata Steel India too. With Europe seeing recovery and prices moving up which will be sustained until the end of Q4, there won’t be any debt from the parent to the UK operations for FY 21 at least,” said an analyst tracking the company, requesting anonymity.

 Given China’s faster-than-expected recovery in demand and prices, EU prices will likely sustain until the end of FY21, said the person cited above."

SBI,"Dec 17, 2020, 07:06 AM IST",Few takers for share sale offers by public banks,"Mumbai: State owned Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Life Insurance Corp (LIC) contolled IDBI Bank managed less than their targeted amounts through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) despite offering the maximum permissible 5% discount to investors highlighting the challenges that government owned lenders face in raising capital from the market.

PNB managed to raise about Rs 3,800 crore out of its targeted Rs 7,000 crore while IDBI Bank managed to raise about Rs 1,400 crore out of its targeted Rs 2,000 crore in the offer, multiple people familiar with the issue said. 

""Both the issues received support from treasuries of public sector banks treasuries especially the large ones like State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Canara and Union Bank of India to help it get through. LIC could not invest in IDBI because it already owns majority stake there but it supported the PNB issue big time,"" said one of the persons cited above.


PNB raised about Rs 3800 crore which included an estimated Rs 1,500 crore from LIC. Other investors in PNB included mid level mutual funds like Sundaram and some hedge funds like Millenium Management Global. PNB was priced at a 5% discount to the Rs 37.35 apiece floor price set by the bank. 

Simiarly, IDBI Bank, which is technically under RBI restrictions under the so called prompt corrective action (PCA) framework, too was priced at a 5% discount to the Rs 40.63 per share floor price set by the bank. Both the banks did not respond to a separate emails seeking comment. Sundaram mutual fund as well as some PSU banks were common investors in both the issues. Individual investors could not be immediately reached for comment.

""LIC could not invest in IDBI but PNB itself is said to have invested Rs 300 crore in the share sale. Indian Bank is said to have bet on both the issuances for Rs 100 crore each. Canara Bank and Union Bank of India are among others that have also subscribed to the issuances,"" said a second person cited above.

ICICI Securties, IIFL Securities, SBI Capital Markets were the bankers to both issues joined by PNB Securities for PNB and IDBI Capital for IDBI Bank among other bankers.

SEBI rules say that for the issue to be sucessfully placed atleast half of the desired amount has to be collected which both banks managed.
""Our base issue was Rs 3500 crore and we wanted to keep whatever came over it. But we got about Rs 3800 crore and the issue has now been closed,"" said a person involved in the PNB issue.

Both the issues highlight the investor sceptism with regards to public sector banks which are still cleaning up their books even as they try to assess the damage done by the Covid 19 pandemic this fiscal. 

Both issues have come even as the government and the RBI have exhorted PSU banks to seek capital from the markets. The government has for the first time in many years not provided for the capitalisation of banks in its annual budget while governor Shaktikanta Das has asked PSU banks to ""stand on the strength of their own balance sheet.""

PNB and IDBI's QIP follows Canara Bank's similar Rs 2,000 crore fund raise last week in which again, LIC was the largest subscriber to this issue, raising questions about whether other large investors will be keen to put money into the two forthcoming issues if the state-run insurer does not step in.

Post the issue the capital adequacy of both banks will roughly improve by 50 basis points each. One basis point is 0.01 percentage point."

Bajaj Finserv, IndusInd Bank, Nestle India and Tata Steel were among the stocks that saw biggest drops in MF holdings, while Adani Ports, Dr Reddy's Labs and HCL Technologies were among a few that saw buying by the desi fund managers during the month.

One of the stocks that saw the biggest selloff by MFs was Bajaj Finserv. Mutual fund holding in terms of number of Bajaj Finserv shares held by 19 mutual funds declined 18.9 per cent during the month to 46 lakh shares.

Mutual funds' total holding in the stock was valued at Rs 4,060 crore at the end of the month, a study by Motilal Oswal Securities showed.

In the case of IndusInd Bank, the number of shares MFs held in the bank fell 16.7 per cent month-on-month to 5.21 crore shares. MF holding on this counter stood at Rs 4,470 crore at the end of the month.

MFs sold 13 per cent of their holdings in Nestle India; 12.8 per cent of their holdings in Tata Steel and 10.3 per cent in Tech Mahindra. Hero MotoCorp, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Britannia Industries, Divi’s Labs, Hindalco Industries, Bajaj Finance, Eicher Motors and NPTC were among the stocks where mutual funds trimmed their stakes in excess of 5 per cent.

""In March, there was a record outflow from FPIs and record buying by domestic institutional investors. If I have to choose a time to invest, I would always choose March over November. If my investors are booking profit, so be it. At lower levels, I will be a buyer rather than a seller. Having said that, November, like October and September, saw profit booking by our clients. We have seen redemptions by people who were in financial need,” said Nilesh Shah of Kotak AMC.

Shah said it is not that fund managers are selling because they find the market expensive. Rather, it’s because investors are redeeming. “Our cash levels remained virtually stagnant over the last eight-nine months,"" he said. 

Redemptions by MF investors rose 26.7 per cent month-on-month (MoM) in November to Rs 28,100-odd crore while sales of equity schemes fell 18.4 per cent MoM to Rs 14,900 crore. This led to the highest ever net outflows of Rs 13,200 crore from mutual funds. 

AgenciesThe handful of stocks that saw buying by these funds during the month included Adani Ports, Dr Reddy's Labs, HCL Tech, Grasim, Maruti Suzuki, UPL, M&M, SBI, Sun Pharma and Coal India.

Mutual funds increased the number of shares they hold in Adani Ports by 7 per cent to 7.73 crore. Eighteen mutual funds owning less than 2 per cent stake in Adani Ports had Rs 3,180 crore worth of exposure in the Adani Group company.

In Dr Reddy's Labs, holdings of 20 mutual funds rose by 5.2 per cent MoM to 2.09 crore shares. In HCL Tech, MF holding rose by 4.8 per cent to 16.98 crore shares. Maruti Suzuki saw MF holding rise 4.3 per cent to 2.36 crore shares. In Grasim, they held 1.7 per cent more shares than in October. UPL saw over 1 per cent rise in the number of shares the MFs held in the company.

M&M, SBI, Sun Pharma and Coal India were some of the companies that saw MF buying during the month.

""Reasons of the selling could vary from risk-profiling to valuation concerns. There are multiple reasons why money is going out and it is natural that when money has been coming in for four-five months at a stretch, some amount of it will go out,"" Swarup Mohanty, CEO at Mirae Asset Global told ETNOW."

SBI,"Dec 15, 2020, 10:16 AM IST",SBI Mutual Fund goes all out for NHPC; picks more midcaps & smallcaps,"NEW DELHI: Fund managers at SBI Mutual Fund continued to accumulate smallcaps and midcaps and dumped big names from the Nifty pack in November, as they saw limited upsides in largecaps after a record rally since March.

The fund house went all out for NHPC, buying over 1 crore shares of the hydroelectric power generator. Power consumption in the country has grown past pre-Covid level with projections for further growth. This has made analysts bullish on the sector.

“If I have to look at it from a two-three years’ perspective, the power sector could be a great turnaround story from the current level. We were power deficit once, but are now in power-surplus mode,” said Yogesh Mehta, Founder of Yield Maximisers.

Besides NHPC, SBI MF grabbed 10-55 lakh shares of Federal Bank, V-Guard Industries, Finolex Industries, Firstsource Solutions and Prism Johnson in November. It also shopped for Solar Industries, Crompton Greaves, ICICI Lombard GE T&D India and IDFC First Bank from the broader market. 

“The broader market continued to look better placed relative to largecaps, thanks to extreme polarisation. We continue to go bottom-up in our approach by focusing on resilient businesses that should emerge stronger on the other side of the current uncertainty,” said Navneet Munot, Chief Investment Officer of SBI Mutual Fund.

Munot has since quit the fund house and has been appointed the new CEO and Managing Director of HDFC Mutual Fund, the No. 2 fund house.

Munot said after the strong bounceback in stocks from March 2020 lows, it will require strong growth and an earnings rebound beyond the reopening-led normalisation for the market to see further upside.

SBI Mutual Fund, the largest fund house in the country, dumped some of the biggest names from elite Nifty50 club, especially banking stocks. It sold 10-35 lakh shares in Axis Bank, Adani Ports, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Power Grid Corporation, Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, M&M and L&T.

It did pick selective largecap stocks, which have been laggards in the ongoing stocks rally. They included Gail India, SBI, Hindalco and ITC.

ITC has recently started seeing major breakouts after underperforming its peers for months. It is still the cheapest FMCG player available among largecaps, and continues to grab eyeballs when everything else has become expensive.

SBI Mutual Fund also built fresh positions in Gland Pharma, Ingersoll-Rand, Shreno and Sobha in November. At the same time, it completely exited Apollo Tyres, GE Power India and Kirloskar Ferrous Industries.

Meanwhile, the fund house further strengthened its lead over its peers in terms of asset managed. It now manages assets worth Rs 4.67 lakh crore, up by Rs 34,000 crore in a month, some of which could be mark-to-market gains."

Thinking of doing lumpsum investments of Rs 20,000 each in (will add more units when the market goes down): Parag Parikh Long Term Equity Fund and Franklin India Feeder US Opportunities Fund.

Can you suggest which funds shall I add/switch to? Can these funds get me a return of 20-25% per annum on my overall investment over a period of 20 years? 

– Varun Bansal 

Ashish Modani, Founder, SLA Financial Solutions, responds:

Let me do some maths based on your expectations. You want to invest Rs 56,000 per month over next 20 year and expecting a return of 20-25%. It means, you would invest around Rs. 1.34 crore and you are expecting around Rs 17 crore @20%, and Rs 37 crore @ 25% returns. 

 The point, is it possible to get such high returns? Well, return on investment largely depends on how underlying economy will perform over long period rather than the funds. In my view, over next decade or so, as we expect Indian economy to grow much bigger and move from developing to developed nation, returns probably would be lesser than what they were in last 20 years. Also, rather than focusing on high returns on investments and investing when markets are lower, it would be better to increase your investments by spending less or by reducing you future requirements. 

As far as fund selection is concerned, it is very difficult to predict what will be the return from these funds over 20 years. The darlings of mutual fund investors 20 years ago are not even talked about today. Every successful fund has gone through times of extreme bad times. Often, investors tend to show interest in funds which have done well in the recent past and leave those which had bad performance. 

In all the funds you have picked up, all had phases of bad performances in the course of their journey. Everyone talks about PPFAS Long term Equity and Franklin Feeder Fund today because of as their performance is great as the US market has grown in last three years or so. Not many people were talking about them three years ago.

Base your investments on your goals and maintain an asset allocation for achieving those goals. Rather than focusing on what you cannot control (fund performances, return etc.), its best to focus on what you can control like restricting your current expenses so that you can increase your savings and maintaining an asset allocation. Review your portfolio once in a year or maximum twice in a year. Take decisions, based on your situation and your portfolio rather than market situation and best performers."
SBI,"Dec 09, 2020, 07:19 AM IST",Ahead of Market: 12 things that will decide stock action on Wednesday,"Nifty touched its all time high on Tuesday, forming a doji candle on the daily chart. This signalS indecisiveness as the benchmark index closed slightly below the opening price of 13,393.85.

Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said, “There is a possibility of a brief pause before the index stretches higher. On the downside, 13,250-13,280 is a near-term support zone and any minor degree dip is likely to find support over there. The overall outlook for the Nifty continues to be positive with the short-term target at 13,700,” he said.

“Since November, PSU banks have been outperforming the market and this rally continued and took Indian benchmark indices to new highs in today’s volatile session. Reports of emergency vaccine rollout in India and hopes of stimulus packages in the US and Japan have also helped in keeping momentum live,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.


That said, here's a look at what some of the key indicators are suggesting for Wednesday's action:US shares dip on rising virus cases
Wall Street's main indexes were trading lower on Tuesday as surging coronavirus cases threatened to hamper an economic revival, while investors awaited progress in ongoing negotiations for a fresh COVID-19 US relief package. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.84 points, or 0.07%, at 30,067.53. The S&P 500 was down by 4.91 points, or 0.14%, at 3,686.75, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 36.77 points, or 0.29%, to 12,483.20.


European shares flat ahead of Brexit trade talks European shares were little changed on Tuesday, as hopes of a Brexit trade deal faded amid a last-ditch attempt to find a solution, while rising coronavirus cases spurred talks of stricter curbs that could cause more economic pain. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.12%, while London's FTSE 100, which has been outperforming regional peers in recent sessions, was trdaing flat at 0.06%.


Tech view: Nifty forms indecisive DojiNifty50 on Tuesday breached the 13,400 level on an intraday basos but could not sustain the gains. Buying was seen later at lows, as the index ended almost where it had opened, thereby forming an indecisive Doji on the daily chart. The index made a higher high higher-low candle for the seventh session in a row, but the advance-decline ratio was slightly tilted in favour of the bears, hinting at wide profit booking in the broader market.

ET had reported about the bank likely raising money through a QIP in October.

The bank's shares rose for the fifth consecutive day on Tuesday, anticipating the demand for shares to increase after the QIP. It ended at Rs 136.80, up 16.38% after touching a high of Rs 141.05 on the Bombay Stock Exchange. They ended higher than the Rs103.50 per share floor price set by the bank.

""Demand was good and the issue was subscribed two times though most of the trade happened around the floor price. Both local and foreign investors participated in the issue,"" said a person involved in the deal.

Investors in the QIP include domestic mutual funds such as Nippon and Aditya Birla and the US-based fund Millennium Management, a second person involved in the process said. Individual investors could not be contacted immediately.

The bone of contention in the discussions is the Rs 1000 crore cash flows BPSL has generated between March and now which both parties do not want to let go. Also on the table is JSW's demand for an indemnity bond or a guarantee from lenders promising to return the full amount paid by JSW if the Supreme Court (SC) order goes against the company. The court is hearing a case involving the Enforcement Directorate (ED) investigation into allegations of fraud against the erstwhile promoters of BPSL. The ED is arguing that the new promoters of BPSL cannot be discharged from any prior liability of offences committed by the corporate debtor.

All these points are part of negotiations between the lenders and JSW. 

""This is a compromise formula being worked out. Technically the insolvency resolution period ended in March which was when the company was given to JSW but the litigation has delayed matters. The initial RFP is silent on what happens to cash flows generated by the company when the resolution period is over. Instead of fighting over it, JSW has put this proposal forward,"" said one of the persons involved in the negotiations.

JSW is offering another Rs 450 crore over and above the Rs 19,350 crore it has offered financial creditors. The company had bid Rs 19,700 crore for the 3.5 million tonne steel plant pipping Tata Steel's Rs 16,000 crore offer and was declared the winner by NCLT in September 2019. The additional offer will take the total bid amount by the company to Rs 20,150 crore of which Rs 350 crore will go to operational creditors. The company did not reply to an email seeking comment.

""An indemnity bond by lenders to JSW is also under consideration promising to give back the money in case the SC ruling is adverse. Similarly JSW is also considering signing a bond promising to give back the company to creditors if the deal does not go through,"" said another person involved in the negotiations.

The SC has not stayed the resolution process so far and the next hearing is only in January so both JSW and lenders want to ensure that they do not waste any time. 

BPSL was among the 12 large cases referred to bankruptcy courts by the RBI in 2017. The company owed lenders Rs 48,000 crore. Though under the terms under negotiations lenders still will take a 58% haircut the Rs 20,150 crore recovery could be the largest in some time as banks are struggling to recover bad loans due the economic recession caused by the Covid 19 pandemic.

With an improved offer JSW wants to capitalise on the two year high steel prices adding 3 million tonnes to the 18 million tonne existing capacity.

""It will take time since there are 36 creditors and many of them who need an okay from their headquarters to go ahead. But both parties are willing to move ahead which is a good sign,"" said the first person quoted above.

SBI,"Dec 07, 2020, 12:12 PM IST","ICICI Bank tells analysts technical outages can happen anytime, banks can only reduce probability","MUMBAI: Chiming in support of peer HDFC Bank, private lender ICICI Bank has told analysts that technical outages are an unfortunate but harsh reality and can happen anytime, a report by Macquarie Capital has revealed. The ICICI bank management also told analysts that the only thing a bank can do is minimise the probability of such events, Macquarie has said. 

Last week, the Reserve Bank of India had asked HDFC Bank to halt launches of all new digital offerings and stop onboarding credit card customers. This is the first time the regulator has imposed business sanctions on a bank for a system outage, indicating a strict stance here on for similar episodes. 

ICICI bank recently hosted its analyst day where the bank showcased their digital capabilities around each of their business verticals and their continued focus to partner with the customers across the entire ecosystem. 

Meanwhile the private lender sounded optimistic on its asset quality and growth prospects despite the pandemic. The bank told analysts that since much of the corporates which had to turn bad have turned bad in the previous cycle, the bank is now left with a more resilient corporate portfolio.

“Hence the pandemic hasn’t affected their portfolio much and they clearly guided for restructured assets to be sub 1%,” said Suresh Ganapathy, associate director, Macquarie Capital, who posted a note on the ICICI Bank analyst meet. “They are also seeing renewed optimism in corporate banking and their recent interactions with corporates indicate that some corporates are more optimistic now than they were pre-covid and this should lead to a revival in capex.”

Steel, cement, and pharma supply chain would be the key sectors driving capex. However, capex will still be initially led by government and PSUs, Ganapathy added. 

The bank also told analysts that the corporate loan book grew 1.3x in the last two years. 

“As per the management, it would be incorrect to say that growth in the corporate banking loan book has been low as reported numbers also include non- performing loans. In fact, originations (direct + funds raised through DCM division) in the performing corporate loan book grew 1.3x in the last two years,” Ganapathy said in his note. 

ICICI Bank is focusing on transforming its role from ‘provider of capital’ to that of a partner providing dealer vendor solutions, reducing working capital cycle which ultimately helps the corporates to increase their top line and thus the focus has been to capture the entire ecosystem through 360-degree banking, Ganapathy said."

With banking taking on an increasingly digital accent each passing day, Mint Road is now buttressing standards around grievance resolution and customer protection to ensure continued confidence in the burgeoning virtual channels that are crucial for financial inclusion.

“Lakhs of internet banking customers cannot be put under distress,” central bank governor Shaktikanta Das said Friday, underscoring the need to strengthen both banking technology systems - and their supervision.

“The financial sector is becoming increasingly IT dependent and requisite investments by banks and NBFCs are necessary,” Das said. “We are constantly engaging with the entities around deficiencies…as the apex regulator of the banking and payment systems, certain action becomes unavoidable.”

He also added that the drastic step to freeze all digital expansion initiatives and credit card sourcing by HDFC Bank on Thursday was necessitated due to “earlier episodes (of outages) and overwhelming presence” the private lender commands in India’s digital banking and payments ecosystem.

“(Whether to impose) monetary penalty or take supervisory action differs” from one case to another, Das said in response to a question on whether the action taken against India’s most valuable lender would become the norm. 

“In the HDFC (Bank) case, due to earlier episodes and overwhelming presence in the internet banking segment, we have concerns around these deficiencies. We have asked them to strengthen IT systems before further clearances. We are certain the bank will comply,” Das added.

The regulator's action follows the bank's inability to fix the problem despite formal instructions over the past few years. It is learnt that the regulator had raised the issue with the bank during its periodic inspections as lakhs of customers and the payments systems were being put at risk because of such interruptions.

The governor also indicated that the central bank will soon publish a new draft framework around the supervisory and regulatory standards for banks to ensure better grievance resolution and consumer protection systems.

“These directions will contain requirements for robust governance, implementation and monitoring of certain minimum standards on common security controls for channels like internet and mobile banking, card payments,” Das said.

Additionally, in the way of policy action to enhance contactless transactions, the central bank also relaxed limits on tap and go payments to Rs 5,000 from the current Rs 2,000.

""This is a welcome step by RBI to increase transactions and e-mandate limit,"" said Dilip Asbe, CEO, NPCI.
""The increased limit will also help to boost the average value of transaction and push the adoption of digital payments.""

The move comes after several representations made by card networks such as Visa and Mastercard.

“As evident in recent months, there is strong consumer preference for digital payments and the new enhanced limits for e-mandates and contactless cards will help transition millions of Indian consumers from cash to fast, convenient and secure forms of digital payments,” said T R Ramachandran, group country manager, India & South Asia, Visa.

The move was also accompanied by easing of norms around e-mandate and everyday settlement of transactions through key National Payments Corporation of India operated channels such as UPI, AePS, RuPay and IMPS. 

“With this enablement, it is proposed to reduce settlement and default risk in the system by facilitating settlement of AePS, IMPS, NETC, NFS, RuPay, UPI transactions on all days of the week. This will make the payments ecosystem more efficient,” Das said in his speech.

He also said that a central bank team is probing outages faced by State Bank of India’s mobile application platform."

Bulls took a pause as Nifty failed to surpass Wednesday’s peak and traded in the negative territory throughout the session, Intraday recovery remained short lived finding resistance near the 12,720 zone. Nifty eventually ended at 11,691, losing 58 points. Appearance of narrow range action at the current juncture represents indecisiveness near 12,700. Hence, follow-up action needs to be closely watched as sustenance below 12,700 could attract some price consolidation.

Bank Nifty lost ~2 per cent, erasing prior session’s gain. Despite positive close, yesterday’s Bank Nifty internal breadth was negative, while in today’s trade, all of Bank Nifty components ended in the red suggesting profit taking across the banking space.

Sectoral trend is mixed and recent leaders (i.e. banking and financials) have underperformed the most in today’s trade.

On options front, Nifty’s 12,700 call strike holds second highest open interest base for the coming weekly expiry; while on the flip side, decisive break below 12,600 could mean that index is due for mean reversion.

Meanwhile, midcap printed consecutive tenth positive close. About 64 per cent of the Midcap100 stocks ended in the green, highlighting positive traction within the midcap space. There could be further stock-specific rally in the near term. 


Future recommendation
Sell SBI Life November future near Rs 841-845


Stop loss: Rs 870
Target: Rs 780
After rallying 12 per cent from the recent low, the stock has retraced 50 per cent of its multi-month down move. Inability to sustain at current levels could drag the stock lower to digest recent gains. 


Option recommendation
Buy UPL (United Phosphorus) 420 strike November put near Rs 11


Stop loss: Rs 6
Target: Rs 21
Series of descending peaks and bottoms remains intact. The recent rally failed to sustain at higher levels. On the flip side, the stock could revisit levels of 400.


Equity recommendation
Buy BEL (Bharat Electronics) near Rs 94


Stop loss: Rs 90
Target: Rs 102
Appearance of a bullish candle on the weekly chart along with RSI bouncing off levels of 40 could mean short-term reversal post multi-month decline. Sustenance above 50-day EMA (i.e. 94) could lift the stock higher till Rs 102 zone.

European shares flat as upbeat earnings offset US stimulus doubtsEuropean stocks hovered near a two-week high on Wednesday as upbeat earnings reports from UK's Tesco and Germany's Dialog Semiconductor helped offset uncertainties surrounding a fresh US stimulus package. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was trading flat, with banks, insurers and energy companies retreating after a rally in the previous session.


Tech View: Nifty vulnerable to profit takingNifty50 on Wednesday jumped for the fifth day in a row and formed a higher high and low. On the daily chart, the index formed a bullish candle. It was not far away from the recent swing high of 11,794 hit on August 31. That said, the broader market is showing clear signs of fatigue and Nifty50 itself looks overbought on the short-term charts. The index needs to clear the 11,750-800 range for any further rise towards the 12,000 mark, analysts said, adding that a failure to do so may trigger profit taking.

Podcast: Where is Nifty headed after 5 days of rally >>>Reliance Industries, HDFC twins and IT firms gave Sensex a 300 point lift today as benchmark indices recorded gains for the fifth day. However, things were grim in the broader market where five stocks fell for every three that rose. Midcap and smallcap indices fell up to 0.7 per cent, reflecting the broader weakness. Nifty 500, the broadest index on NSE, was down 0.45 per cent. We caught up with Deepak Jasani- Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities who gave us his views on the quarterly results ahead."
SBI Life,"Sep 25, 2020, 03:36 PM IST","Sensex jumps 835 points, Nifty above 11,000: Top factors behind market rally","NEW DELHI: A low-level buying on Friday supported by positive global cues helped domestic equity indices recoup over half of the losses sustained in the previous session even as the risks and worries over Covid-19 and economy remained.

The 30-share pack Sensex jumped 835 points or 2.28 per cent at 37,389. The 50-share NSE Nifty rose in tandem and was up 245 points or 2.26 per cent at 11,050. If benchmark indices manage to hold the gains till closing then they will snap six-day losing run but both are poised to report big weekly losses.

The level of volatility also declined as trading of October series contracts began. India VIX was down 11.68 per cent to 20.76.

Among bluechips, HCL Tech was the biggest gainer, up 5.42 per cent followed by Bharti Airtel, Cipla, IndusInd Bank, TCS, Adani Ports, Bajaj Finance and Eicher Motors that added 3-5 per cent. SBI Life Insurance, BPCL and Kotak Mahindra Bank were among a few names that witnessed selling pressure.

Broader market indices also rebounded with Nifty Smallcap advancing 1.84 per cent and Nifty Midcap climbing 1.60 per cent. Among sectoral indices, Nifty IT and Nifty Pharma were top gainers.

Here are the key factors driving markets:



Firm global cues
The overnight rally in the US tech stocks boosted sentiments back home and helped bring buyers back into the market. Meanwhile, a recovery in Asian markets also proved to be constructive.

Shares on Wall Street ended positive in choppy trade on Thursday, led by a dogged comeback in the technology sector, having initially sold off on higher-than-expected unemployment claims. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent, the S&P 500 gained 0.30 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.37 per cent.



Low-level buying
After 2,750-point fall in Sensex, and even more in broader markets, valuation of some of the stocks has come down sharply, which attracted buyers back on the Street. 

Few analysts also said the market fall has presented investors to accumulate quality names. Gurmeet Chadha, Co-Founder & CEO, Complete Circle Consultants said investors should keep accumulating quality stocks with decline but warned that one should not simply buy just because you have seen a 2,000-point correction in one week.



US stimulus coming?
Investors also took relief from the news that Democrats in the US House of Representatives are working on a $2.2 trillion coronavirus package that could be voted on next week. If that attempt to pass the bill is successful, it can give a massive boost to the economy and the world markets.

In the interim, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin highlighted as much as $380 billion from the US Congress' last big coronavirus aid package is unused and could help households and businesses if lawmakers approve."

Punjab National Bank, IDBI Bank: State owned Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Life Insurance Corp (LIC) controlled IDBI Bank managed less than their targeted amounts through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) despite offering the maximum permissible 5 per cent discount to investors highlighting the challenges that government owned lenders face in raising capital from the market.

Wipro,"Dec 14, 2020, 04:24 PM IST",Whistle-blower plaints at Nifty cos up 17% in FY20,"Mumbai: Erosion of about Rs 4,000 crore of market cap of the UPL stock in the wake of a whistle-blower complaint yet again underscored the significance of serious whistle-blowers in India Inc. An analysis by the ET Intelligence Group has revealed a 17 per cent increase in whistle-blower complaints received by Nifty-50 companies in 2019-20, with 19 member companies cumulatively disclosing a record number of 5,307 complaints.

Just three companies accounted for 70 per cent of these complaints, with IT firm Wipro topping the list, closely followed by the country’s largest lender, State Bank of India, and another leading IT company Tech Mahindra.

To be sure, most of these complaints tended to be of a non-serious nature. For instance, as per Wipro’s annual report, the top categories of complaints were workplace concerns and harassment (34 per cent), and people processes (32 per cent). Most of the cases (82 per cent) were resolved through engagement of human resources or mediation, or closed since they were unsubstantiated.


Experts said the increase in whistle-blower complaints in corporate India was an encouraging sign. “The longer and deeper the vigil mechanism takes roots, the wider is the variety of the complaints that involve employers or seniors at work, customers or suppliers, members of the public, as well as personal grievances.” said Milind Sarwate, independent director on several Indian boards.

Whistle-blower complaints are not actively tracked by institutional investors till a serious one emerges that flags issues related to corporate governance, insider trading or financial fraud. Most of the leading companies of the benchmark index shied away from disclosing the actual number of complaints received by them during the year, despite having a whistle-blower policy and complaint mechanism in place.

The number of companies that did not disclose the number of complaints rose to 31 in 2019-20 from 23 in the previous financial year. While a few companies merged whistle-blower complaints with overall stakeholder complaints, others did not cite them at all.

“A process with no complaints is not a good situation to be in.” Sarwate told ET. “It could indicate that the people covered by the mechanism are either unaware of it or are scared of the consequences or both.”

Public sector companies in Nifty cited the number of vigilance cases with no separate list of whistle-blower complaints. “Reporting of whistle-blower complaints needs to be much more granular,” said Shriram Subramanian of InGovern, a proxy advisory firm. “There is no uniform guideline on what needs to be reported and how.”For example, while IT bellwether Infosys said it had received 909 complaints related to disciplinary issues, it did not say how many among these were whistle-blower complaints.

In November 2019, a whistle-blower had accused the company’s CEO of indulging in “misdeeds”."

Wipro,"Dec 07, 2020, 12:38 PM IST",New CEO drives Wipro's stock up 70% without stepping into office,"In the five months since he took over as chief executive officer of Wipro Ltd., Thierry Delaporte has yet to visit the Indian outsourcer’s Bangalore headquarters once. Instead, the 53-year-old has been on a virtual tour from his home in Paris, meeting with managers, workers and customers around the globe.

He’s trying to turn around the struggling business without letting the Covid-19 pandemic slow him. Delaporte slashed the top ranks of leadership from 25 people to four. He stepped up acquisitions, with more on the way. Mostly, he focused his attention on customers, meeting with 130 over video conference and helping to land new multi-year contracts with clients in the U.S. and Europe.

The company’s stock has rallied about 70% since his appointment, most among India’s four largest outsourcing firms during that period. It’s a rare victory for Wipro, but one the veteran of France’s Capgemini SE is determined won’t be its last. He hopes to get Wipro back on track after years of tumult and stagnating financials.

“There’s a particular momentum in the industry just now, and I want to drive that urgency to put Wipro back where it belongs,” said Delaporte, speaking from Paris in his first interview since assuming the CEO post. “I know I’m good at one thing - getting things done.”

Wipro needs more than enthusiasm. The firm, majority owned by billionaire Azim Premji, has lagged its peers for years. In the fiscal year ended in March, revenues rose 3.9% in constant currency terms, compared with 9.8% at Infosys Ltd. and 7.1% at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. -- even though both are far larger. HCL Technologies Ltd., which displaced Wipro as the third-largest in the industry two years ago, grew 17%.

Delaporte’s predecessor, Abidali Neemuchwala, took over in 2016 with similar ambitions. He departed after a turbulent four years and falling well short of a target to build Wipro into a $15 billion company by 2020. (Its revenue for the year ended in March was $8.1 billion.)

“Thierry seems to have the vision and the commitment, but he has an absolutely daunting task,” said Vasupradha Srinivasan, a senior analyst at Forrester Research Inc.

Wipro shares were little changed Monday.

BloombergDelaporte, whose hobby is long-distance running, is realistic that any turnaround will take time. But, he argues, the business is actually simple: Obsess over helping your clients and the rest will follow.

“We know what we need to do to make it work,” he said, from an office whose walls are adorned with paintings. “In my Year One, we’ll accelerate growth; in Year Two, we’ll be at the growth level of our competitors; and in Year Three, we will outdo.”

While the U.S. is Wipro’s biggest market now, Delaporte sees opportunity in Europe and Asia. He’s put together a new deals team -- headed by a chief growth officer -- to go after big client contracts. In the last few weeks, Wipro has landed orders from European clean energy producers Fortum Oyj and E.On SE.

The company has also stepped up its acquisitions. He says he has signed more deals in the past five months than in the previous five years -- and plans to keep going.

“I am confident you will see a bolder and a more ambitious Wipro as we move ahead,” said Rishad Premji, the company’s chairman.

Picked from a crowded field of candidates, Delaporte was a surprise choice. The Frenchman is the first CEO of an India-based outsourcer who’s not of Indian ethnicity, a shift that reflects the industry’s transition.

The business used to be simple, pay-by-the-hour labor arbitrage where Indian firms could substitute their own workers for more highly compensated tech staff in the U.S. and Europe. Now firms need to deliver innovation and strategic insights with global impact, helping their customers figure out new ways to capitalize on cloud computing, data analytics and artificial intelligence. The challenge of that new mission is reflected in industry growth rates that were once regularly in double digits and have since crashed.

The coronavirus hammered the business this year. Lockdowns forced companies to schlep computers and backup batteries to workers’ homes.

Yet the pandemic could prove to be a boon. Companies are stepping up their spending on technology and the largest outsourcers are reporting a faster-than-expected recovery. Wipro had stopped making revenue forecasts this year, along with the rest of the industry, but has since restarted, projecting 1.5% to 3.5% sequential growth in the current quarter.

“Though it hasn’t always been the case in the past,” said Delaporte, “we’ll deliver on our forecast.”

When he needs to think or wind down, Delaporte puts on his running shoes and hits the streets of Paris, clocking about 40 kilometers every week. “When I run more and more, I’m clearer in my mind,” he said.

That’s helped give him clarity on the tenuous nature of his place at Wipro, even with a five-year CEO contract.

“If Wipro is not growing, I’ll be the first one to go,” he said. “There’s no other way.”"
Wipro,"Dec 03, 2020, 07:34 AM IST",Ahead of Market: 12 things that will decide stock action on Thursday,"Nifty made a strong comeback after a bout of profit booking and managed to close in the green on Wednesday.

The headline index formed a hanging man candle for the second consecutive day signalling that the market players are sceptical of the 50-pack's run, clinching all-time highs repeatedly for the past one month. Failing to breach its month-long resistance levels and increasing volatility can lead to further profit booking. 

According to Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities, the short-term trend of Nifty continues to be positive with rangebound action. “The market is expected to face stiff resistance around 13,150 or slightly higher in the coming sessions. A sustainable move above this area could open some more upside for the market,” said Shetti.

While formation of hanging man after a reasonable up move is considered as a warning signal for reversal of trend post confirmation, however, since this pattern is formed amidst a range-bound movement, the immediate negative implication could be doubtful, analysts said.

“We’re seeing consolidation in the index but the bias is still on the positive side. Going ahead, further updates on Covid vaccines and cues from the global markets will remain in focus. Besides, on the domestic front, RBI’s monetary policy meet would also be on investors' radar. The MPC is likely to maintain the status quo. However, their commentary on growth and inflation would be critical,” said Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking.

Analysts said the 12,800 level would remain a major support for the index in the coming days, but if it takes out the record high of 13,145 level, it would send out a signal of strength for the index. Nifty50 seems to be in a no-trade zone, as is evident from the fact that neither the bulls nor the bears were being able to have an upper hand by the end of the session, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

Wipro,"Nov 27, 2020, 10:58 AM IST",100% rise since March low. Should you still consider top Nifty gainers?,"NEW DELHI: As Nifty50 hit an all-time high of 13,145 on Wednesday, rising from a low of 7,515 hit on March 24, eight index stocks have doubled investors’ money, rising anywhere between 100 per cent and 174 per cent.

Five of these stocks have consensus ‘buy’, two have 'hold' while one an ‘underperform’ ratings now.


These list includes:


IndusInd Bank: Outperform
Up 174 per cent since March 24, this banking stock has 18 'buy' calls, 12 'outperform', 10 ‘hold’, three 'underperform' and two 'sell' ratings, as per publicly available Reuters' Eikon database. Analysts said the recent capital raising has strengthened the balance sheet and the bank may gradually see improvement in profitability as credit costs normalise. Nomura India expects a credit cost of 310 basis points for FY21 and 190 bps for FY22. It pegs loan growth for the bank at 4 per cent for FY21 and 12 per cent for ROE is seen at 8 per cent for FY21 and 12 per cent for FY22.


M&M: Outperform
Shares of this automaker have 16 'buy' calls, 18 'outperform', two 'hold', one 'underperform' and two 'sell' calls. Phillip Capital expects M&M to benefit from relatively buoyant sentiment in the rural economy due to good Rabi harvest, expectation of high Kharif harvest and higher MSPs. The brokerage in a note said that light commercial vehicles are doing well and the launch of Thar followed by Scorpio and XUV500 facelifts should shore up personal vehicle volumes.

“The company continues to follow up on its commitment to address capital allocation concerns by being prudent and culling loss making subsidiaries gives us comfort,"" the brokerage noted. The stock is up 169 per cent since March 24 against Nifty's 75 per cent rise.


Tata Motors: Hold
In a note this week, Edelweiss said it is positive on JLR’s upcoming product pipeline, which will improve its mix towards the more profitable Land Rover brand. Demand across some of its key markets should normalise it said, adding that a tight cost control should bolster profitability.

""We believe the capex cycle has peaked and containing capex spend should also spur JLR’s FCF. For the India business, after two years of slowdown, we expect volumes to recover gradually,"" it said. FCF stands for free cash flow,"" it said. HDFC Institutional Equities has also upgraded the stock to ‘buy’. While brokerages are turning positive on the stock, the stock still has a consensus 'hold' rating, as per Reuters' Eikon database, following a 153 per cent rise since March 24.


Hindalco: Buy
This aluminium maker has 13 'buy' and 10 'outperform' calls, but no 'hold', 'underperform' or 'sell' calls. JM Financial said Hindalco’s strategic capital allocation in downstream rolling (Novelis, Aleris) has helped the company establish itself as a market leader in aluminium rolled products, revamping its legacy business model of being an aluminium manufacturer and reducing Ebitda volatility vis-à-vis peers in the process.

“India operations with its 90 per cent plus coal security stands to benefit disproportionately with the rise in LME aluminium price. Hindalco’s investment appeal comes from the rising volumes at Novelis enabling operating leverage to kick-in, FCF yield of 13-16 per cent over FY22E-FY23 making way for significant de-leveraging, now that the bulk of the capex is behind,"" it said. The stock is up 153 per cent since March 24.


JSW Steel: Hold
This steel stock has four 'buy', four 'outperform' 13 'hold', six 'underperform' and three 'sell' ratings. Analysts said while volume improvement is all likely, iron ore cost to the company may stay high despite improving integration, as captive iron ore is coming at a huge premium and would thus limit spread improvement. High debt and tendency for continuous expansion keeps them cautious following a 132 per cent rise in the stock since March 24. The company so far is not expecting net debt to increase in FY21, excluding that related to Bhushan power acquisition.


Grasim: Outperform
This auto stock has two 'buy', four 'outperform' and five 'hold' calls. It has no ‘underperform’ or ‘sell’ ratings, as per Reuters' database. Edelweiss said Grasim is a value play as its 57 per cent stake in UltraTech Cement alone, excluding the holding company, and exceeds its current market-cap by 46 per cent. “With the worst being largely behind for standalone business and management’s focus on prioritising capital for organic growth is positive,” the brokerage said.

The risk of investment in group companies like Vodafone Idea remains a key overhang and the reason behind the holding company discount, said Kotak Securities which has an 'add' rating on the stock. The stock is up 114 per cent since March 24.


RIL: Outperform
This stock has 11 'buy' calls, nine 'outperform' seven 'hold', four 'underperform' and one 'sell' ratings. Prabhudas Lilladher said the company's stated objective is to monetise and forge global partnership across businesses, is well positioned to incubate new business and pursue inorganic opportunities given its liquid balance sheet. “Despite a sharp run-up in stock prices, we believe positive news flow on global partnerships or stake sale is likely to keep valuations at elevated level,” it said in a note. This stock has gained 111 per cent since March lows.


Wipro: Underperform
The IT stock, which has rallied 100 per cent since March 24, is a consensus ‘underperform’, as per Reuters. At its analyst day, Wipro’s MD & CEO Thierry Delaporte shared his plan for a bolder Wipro and to revive the company's growth by having a high performance culture and simplification of its organisation structure. Following that, IDBI Capital has introduced its FY23 financials and forecast revenue and upgraded the stock's target to Rs 366 based on PE of 18 times FY23, which is near to the top-end of the one-year forward P/E range of 10-21 times in the last five years.

The stock was ruling at Rs 353 level on Wednesday. Emkay Global said it would like to see concrete signs of sustainable operating performance before taking a constructive view on the stock."
Wipro,"Nov 27, 2020, 10:25 AM IST","Sensex slips 45 points amid doubts over Covid vaccine; Nifty tests 13,000","NEW DELHI: Auto and pharma names saw buying in Friday's session but could not give enough lift to the benchmark indices as selling in RIL and IT stocks pushed them below the flatline amid rising doubts over AstraZeneca vaccine.

Volatility came further down, indicating waning nervousness among the traders but it still remains relatively elevated. Analysts are expecting the market to consolidate after a massive rally.

""Markets are likely to consolidate around the current levels in the short run. However, in the medium term, markets are likely to turn increasingly volatile. Valuations are high and therefore upside is limited. Stick to bluechips, particularly in performing sectors like IT and financials. If Sensex moves beyond 45,000, increase cash levels. Invest in mid-small-caps through mutual funds,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.


Factors driving markets


AstraZeneca vaccine faces questions: Efficacy of the vaccine is now facing more intense scrutiny, which experts say could delay its approval. Several scientists have raised doubts about the robustness of results showing the shot was 90 per cent effective in a sub-group of trial participants who, by error initially, received a half dose followed by a full dose.


More stimulus coming?: Raising the prospect for further stimulus, the European Central Bank's chief economist warned that tolerating ""a longer phase of even lower inflation"" would hurt consumption and investment.


Trump all but concedes: Trump said on Thursday he will leave the White House if the Electoral College votes for Biden, the closest he has come to conceding the Nov. 3 election, even as he repeated his unfounded claims of massive voter fraud.


How are bluechips doing
After opening with gains, benchmark indices drifted lower. At 10.05 am, BSE flagship Sensex was down 45.47 points or 0.10 per cent to 44,214.27. NSE benchmark Nifty followed and dipped 16.65 points or 0.13 per cent to 12,970.

“The resistance level for the Nifty is at 13,050 and if we can cross that, we could head to 13,200 by next week. A strong support lies at 12,800 and thereafter at 12,500. It is only post the breaking of 12,500 that we would consider a short term correction. Until then, the trend remains bullish with a strong upside momentum,” said Manish Hathiramani, proprietary index trader and technical analyst, Deen Dayal Investments.

In the 50-share pack Nifty, Tata Motors was the biggest gainer, up 4.58 per cent. Bajaj Auto, NTPC, Britannia Industries, GAIL, Bajaj Finance, Maruti Suzuki and L&T were among other gainers.

HDFC Life Insurance was the top loser in the pack, down 1.9 per cent. Power Grid, TCS, HDFC, SBI, Reliance Industries, Wipro, UltraTech Cement and Infosys were other losers.


Broader markets
Broader market indices saw buying outperforming their headline peers in morning trade. Nifty Smallcap rose 0.60 per cent while Nifty Midcap added 1.23 per cent. Broadest index on NSE, Nifty 500 was up 0.14 per cent.

Gujarat State Petronet, Adani Gas, Gujarat Gas, Wockhardt, Vakrangee and Rallis India were among major gainers from the space while Alok Industries, Strides Pharma, DCM Shriram, Future Retail, Indiabulls Housing Finance and Vodafone Idea were under selling pressure.


Global markets
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.11 per cent but remained with striking distance of a life-time peak touched this week. Australian shares were down 0.56 per cent. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.12 per cent in choppy trade.

Wipro,"Nov 24, 2020, 09:33 PM IST",Ahead of Market: 12 things that will decide stock action on Wednesday,"Nifty breached the crucial 13,000 barrier and traded above the mark for almost the entire session before ending 128.70 points or 1.0 per cent higher at 13,055.15 on Tuesday, forming a bullish candle, suggesting that bulls tightened their grip on the market. Nifty has gained 12 per cent so far this month.

With this, Nifty finally gave a consolidation breakout after six trading sessions, said Chandan Taparia of Motilal Oswal Securities.

The headline index climbed to its lifetime high as FIIs rained cash on Dalal Street as the foreign inflow breached the highest level on a monthly basis for the calendar year with no signs of these floodgates being shut in the near term. These upbeat sentiments were further bolstered by strong global cues on the raising hopes of a successful Covid-19 vaccine.

""Going ahead, 13,100 is the immediate hurdle to watch out for. Beyond that, the index can march towards 13,350. A fall below 12,960, which was earlier acting as a resistance, will now act as a support as per the principle of role reversal,"" said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst at Sharekhan.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said, “Market is inching higher with more confidence that Covid-19 vaccine will be available in India soon. It can provide an advantage to India compared to the rest of the world. Foreign inflows are already on a new high on a monthly basis due to risk on strategy on healthier emerging markets like India. Recently, the broader market, including mid and smallcaps, have started to perform better, which may continue in the short term as largecaps look expensive post the solid rally from the Covid low.""

European shares rise on possible easing of virus curbsEuropean shares held near eight-month highs on Tuesday as a possible easing of lockdowns in France added to a brighter mood from encouraging developments related to coronavirus vaccines. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.8% at 0900 IST, supported by strong gains in the travel sector and oil & gas stocks after crude prices hit their highest levels since late March.


Tech view: Nifty bulls eyeing 13,350 level nowNifty50 on Tuesday broke above the crucial resistance of 13,000-mark with ease. The index formed a bullish candle on the daily chart. Analysts said the bulls seem to be in no mood to give in. They believe the index could flirt with the 13,350 level in the coming days. “The hourly Bollinger Bands that had become flat, have started expanding, in line with the fresh up move. Going ahead, 13,100 is the immediate hurdle to watch out for. Beyond that, the index can march towards 13,350,"" said Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst at Sharekhan.

Podcast: Nifty @ 13k: Ominous signs investors should watch out for >>>As the benchmark equity indices logged new all-time highs, investors on Dalal Street grew richer by Rs 1.35 lakh crore. Nifty closed above the psychologically-important 13,000-mark for the first time ever. With Nifty Bank gaining the most, all sectoral indices ended the day in green. We caught up with Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services to understand what strategy retail investors should adopt."
Wipro,"Nov 24, 2020, 03:50 PM IST","TCS, Infy, Lupin, Zee among 24 stocks looking strong for a rally","NEW DELHI: As Nifty50 hit the psychologically important 13,000 mark for the first time, at least two dozen stocks in the broader market – including four IT biggies and a handful of pharma stocks – are looking strong on the technical charts, as suggested by moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The momentum indicator signalled bullish crossovers — a sign of bullish undertone — in 24 counters, hinting at possible upsides in the days ahead.

The list included IT majors TCS, Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies, besides pharma names Lupin, Ipca Laboratories, Laurus Labs and Vivimed Labs. Zee Entertainment, Torrent Power, Infibeam Avenues, CG Power, Abbott India, Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Kitex Garments were among other stocks sending out bullish signals on their daily charts.




MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal line’, is plotted on top of the MACD chart to indicate ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

There are 14 stocks showing bearish trends. They included Ashok Leyland, Axis Bank, TVS Motor, City Union Bank, Salasar Technologies and Deccan Cements, among others.


The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

This is because MACD is a trend-following indicator. Though traders can increase the sensitivity of the MACD by using shorter-term moving averages for computing MACD (e.g. 5-day and 12-day moving averages), the lag effect will still be there. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

On Tuesday, Nifty50 traded 1 per cent higher near the 13,050 mark.

“On the daily time frame, Nifty continues to display a very strong trend, as the ADX remains at elevated levels and the MACD is in the ‘buy’ mode. When Nifty is in a trend, avoid selling short for the time being. A break above the 13,000 level should propel the index higher towards 13,084 level. There is a strong likelihood that Nifty will trade higher going into the last three days of the F&O series,” said independent analyst Manish Shah.

Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities advised traders to go long on Nifty50 above 12,970 level for targets of 13,100 and 13,180 levels. “Below 12,800 level, the index would gradually fall to 12600 level,” he said.

Understanding MACD
A close look at the stock chart of TCS shows whenever the MACD line has breached above the signal line, the stock has shown an uptrend and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip traded at Rs 2,736, up 0.43 per cent."
Wipro,"Nov 23, 2020, 04:56 PM IST","Buying in RIL, IT stocks drives Sensex 195 points higher","NEW DELHI: Reliance Industries, along with top pharma and IT stocks, gave a boost to the benchmark indices when most banking stocks saw profit booking taking them to fresh intraday record highs. 

Positive global cues, especially rally in global markets and an early deployment of vaccines, also helped the sentiments. However, India VIX spiked, indicating rising nervousness of investors. 

The 30-share pack Sensex added 194.95 points or 0.44 per cent to 44,077. Its broader peer NSE Nifty climbed 67.40 points or 0.52 per cent to 12,926.45.

Wipro,"Nov 20, 2020, 12:02 PM IST","980 NSE stocks trade above 50, 200-DMAs. What does it mean?","The ongoing rally in domestic stocks this November has significantly widened the distance between Nifty and its 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages (DMAs), indicating strength in the bull run.

The 50-share Nifty has jumped 10 per cent to 12,772 as of November 19 from the October 30 close of 11,642. This rally has also taken 980 stocks, which accounts over half of the active stocks in NSE’s listed universe, well above their short and long-term moving averages.

ETMarkets.comIn general, traders and investors use three major daily moving averages – 50-day, 100-day and 200-day – to spot trend in a stock or an index. When a stock trades above all these DMAs, it is supposed to signal an upward trend. They provide useful information about support and resistance levels.

The 50-,100- and 200 DMAs are used most commonly by traders and analysts. They are used to identify short-term and long-term trends and work as key support and resistance levels for the index.

“Traders tend to prefer 50 DMA and 100 DMA while investors tend to use the 200-DMA more to identify trends. The 200-DMA is a key indicator that determines an overall long-term bull market. Thus whenever an underlying asset takes support or surpasses the 200-DMA, it gives a clear signal of trend reversal and of the right time to enter a stock,” said Nilesh Jain, Technical and Derivatives Research-Equity Research, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

The 200-day moving average, also known as long-term moving average, acts as a crucial support for an index or a stock, while the 100-day average reflects a six-month timeframe and the 50-day average measures a quarter.

Some analysts caution market participants to not use moving averages in isolation. There are various other methods in which such averages and their combinations can be used to gauge the strength and a likely shift in trading momentum.

Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist for Technical Research & Trading Advisory at Chartview India, said when a stock trades above 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages, it means the scrip is in a strong uptrend.

“But this should not be the sole criteria to decide an entry point. Such stocks can provide great opportunity on corrections, especially when they reach, respect and bounce back from the said averages. Apart from these averages, traders should also make use of other technical indicators while deciding exit and entry points,” he said.

Other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, MACD, candlestick patterns and stochastic can also be used to make a buy or sell decision.

Milan Vaishnav, Consulting Technical Analyst and Founder, Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory, said high-beta stocks that have seen a sharp run-up should be avoided at this point.

“One should look at stocks with good RSIs. We like pharma, consumption and non-discretionary sectors,” he said.

Stocks like Adani Power, Adani Ports, Aditya Birla Capital, Wipro, Voltas, V-Mart Retail, Wonderla Holidays, VIP Clothing, Varroc Engineering, TVS Motor Company, TCS, Tata Elxi, Tata Steel Long Products were seen trading above these moving averages on Thursday.

ETMarkets.com“Whenever a stock surpasses all the short-term and long-term moving averages, it reflects a strong uptrend and further momentum. So it is always advisable to give importance to all the moving averages for trading as well as investing. As a thumb rule, if the price is above the moving averages, the trend is upward and if the price is below the moving averages, the trend is downward,” Jain said.

Considering the prevailing bullish trend in the market, Jain said he is bullish on Bata India, Bharat Forge, DLF, Avenue Supermarts, Jindal Steel, Siemens and Voltas.

Ashis Biswas, Head of Technical Research at CapitalVia Global Research, said momentum indicators RSI and MACD are both showing negative divergence as of now. “If Nifty goes below 12,750 level, it may open the gate for a movement till the 12,510-12,520 zone. From a short-term perspective, we retain our cautious stance as the current rally is not supported by other bullish technical evidence,” he said."

Investment RationaleThe company is seeing a healthy deal pipeline within the small and medium size segment. However, it is seeing a huge declines y-o-y in most of its verticals’ revenues except in case of Healthcare as of Q2-2021. Similarly, the US and Europe revenue have declined y-o-y as of Q2- 2021. The brokerage believes the company may take a couple of quarters before it can fall back to its pre-COVID levels of business growth on a y-o-y basis. Nevertheless, increased demand for digitization coupled with recovery and consistent growth across all its verticals, horizontals and geographies should help it regain momentum in the business and profits growth over medium – long term. The company is trading at 22x TTM PE (as of Q2-2021) against an industry average TTM PE of 27x. As a result, the brokerage believes the company is steeply undervalued at the current PE levels.

Driven by likely consistent growth in its digital offerings, recovery and growth in its prominent geogra- phies and verticals, and the fact that they can resort to buybacks in the future given healthy cash balance they hold, it arrives at a target price for Wipro’s shares at Rs.586 on a DCF basis over a long term and hence recommend a BUY on the stock.

Wipro,"Nov 19, 2020, 08:40 AM IST",Wipro growth has been modest in the past: CEO,"(This story originally appeared in  on Nov 19, 2020)BENGALURU: Wipro CEO Thierry Delaporte said the company's growth has been modest and far less than its competitors in the past. He said the recent organisational changes are a way of ""course correction"" to have a razor-sharp focus on growth by focusing on specific geographies.

""We will strengthen relations with strategic clients, win larger deals, and focus investment in industry specific solutions,"" Delaporte said in an analyst meeting on Wednesday. Wipro's growth has lagged those of rivals like Infosys and TCS because of a host of factors, including weakness in the healthcare vertical in the US, problems with the Middle East business, and inability to win large deals.

While the US and the UK will continue to remain focus markets, the company wants to bring more attention to Europe, Middle East and Asia. ""In the US, we will focus on all sectors, but let's say in Switzerland, we will focus on life sciences, BFSI, heavy industries and consumer,"" Delaporte said.

Wipro announced a major organisational overhaul last week, reducing the number of business units, putting the focus on geographies instead of industry verticals, and giving more powers to profit and loss owners. Each customer will now have a global account executive - a senior leader who will represent the account and will be supported by a team. The leader will have greater decision-making powers. The company is also set to appoint a chief growth officer.

""We need to have an obsession for growth, which will come though stronger market orientation, proximity to customers, focus on simplicity rather than perfection, and with fewer but relevant growth metrics,"" said chairman Rishad Premji. Wipro, Delaporte said, is not in a position to focus on all sectors across all geographies as it does not have the size. ""The cost is spread everywhere but not the return on investments,"" he said."

JSW Steel,"Dec 13, 2020, 12:29 PM IST",JSW Steel's Dolvi Works plant expansion may be completed by March-end,"New Delhi: The expansion of JSW Steel's Dolvi Works plant from 5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) to 10 MTPA is expected to be completed by the end of this fiscal year, a company official has said. Located on the west coast of India at Dolvi in Maharashtra, Dolvi Works is JSW Steel's integrated steel plant having current capacity of 5 MTPA. 

 The company is in process to double its capacity to 10 MTPA with an investment of about Rs 15,000 crore. 

 ""We are aiming to complete the expansion of Dolvi Works by the second half of this fiscal (March 2021-end),"" JSW Steel Director - Commercial Marketing and Corporate Strategy Jayant Acharya said. 

 According to the company, due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the expansion of Dolvi Work was affected. The work was suspended because of multiple reasons including non-availability of workers and travel restrictions -- both domestic and international. 

 The company received the permission to restart activities towards the end of April 2020. 

 JSW Steel further said the expansion of the plan includes installing a 4.5 MTPA blast furnace with a supporting 5 MTPA Steel Melt Shop (SMS) and a 5 MTPA Hot Strip Mill (HSM). 

 The plant would also have an 8 MTPA pellet plant and four kilns of 600 TPD Lime Calcination Plants (LCPs), besides a captive power plant. ""About 95 per cent work related to expansion of the plant is completed,"" JSW Steel said. With the expansion of the Dolvi Works, Sajjan Jindal-owned JSW Steel's total steel making capacity will reach to 23.1 MTPA, from 18.1 MTPA at present. Besides 5 MTPA Dolvi Works, JSW Steel owns and operates a 12 MTPA manufacturing facility at Vijayanagar in Karnataka, which is the largest single location steel-producing facility in India, and another 1 MTPA plant in Salem, Tamil Nadu. The company, which is in expansion mode, has also proposed to set up a 13.2 MTPA greenfield steel plant in Odisha along with a 900 MW power plant for captive usage with an investment amount of Rs 53,700 crore."
JSW Steel,"Dec 11, 2020, 10:21 PM IST",Icra revises JSW Steel’s outlook to stable from negative,"Rating agency Icra on Friday has revised its outlook for JSW Steel to Stable from negative on the back of improving operating conditions which will lead to better profitability.

“The revision in the rating outlook reflects Icra’s expectation that JSW Steel Limited’s credit metrics would continue to improve in the near term on the back of improving operating conditions, leading to better profitability,” said Moody’s Indian arm, Icra said in a statement.

JSW Steel’s operating performance is expected to improve in the current fiscal following a sharp hike in domestic steel prices and supportive domestic demand conditions post Q1 FY2021.

“While domestic iron ore prices have spiked recently due to supply disruption in Odisha, JSW Steel’s spreads are likely to remain healthy in the near term owing to favourable sales realisations and softer coking coal prices,” the rating agency said.

JSW Steel’s cash and cash equivalents of Rs. 7,664 crore as on September 30, 2020 and the fact that the company raised foreign currency bonds worth $500 million and domestic NCDs worth Rs 4000 crore in October 2020 largely to repay its debt maturing in the next 12-18 months to turn positive for the company’s liquidity position.

“JSW Steel’s liquidity is adequate given the healthy cash flow from operations expected in FY2021,” the statement said.

Icra’s ratings factors in the company’s diversified product mix with a large share of higher value added products in the sales mix, along with its ability to shift between export and domestic markets, which reduces geographical concentration risks.

“There is increasing raw material security, with the company starting operations of all four iron ore mines in Odisha and two out of three additional iron ore mines in Karnataka in the current fiscal,” the media statement said.

JSW Steel is in the process of enhancing its installed capacities of steel-making and downstream facilities by 6.0 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) and 3.95 mtpa respectively at competitive capital costs by the end of FY2022. With the acquisition of Asian Colour Coated Ispat Limited (ACCIL) in October 2020, JSW Steel’s downstream capacity would increase further by 1.0 mtpa. The 5-mtpa capacity expansion programme at Dolvi has been delayed and is now slated to start operations by the end of FY2021.

“Any further delay in ramping up the capacity and achieving the desired operating parameters would disrupt the improvement in JSW Steel’s credit metrics and hence remains a key monitorable,” Icra added.

The ratings also factor in the company’s large capital expenditure to be incurred over the next two years and its aggressive inorganic growth plans, which would keep the overall debt levels elevated and limit any major improvement in the capital structure in the medium term.

“The pending capex of Rs. 16,387 crore during FY2022-23 would keep the overall debt levels elevated and keep JSW Steel’s free cash flows under pressure in the near-to-medium term,” Icra’s statement said.

ICRA also notes that the proposed acquisition of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd, if successful, would be largely debt funded, which along with the absence of fresh equity raising by JSW Steel, is expected to adversely impact its consolidated financial risk profile and keep the overall debt levels elevated in the near-to-medium term.

Even though the BPSL deal will elevate the overall debt levels, Icra noted that it expects the acquisition to provide synergy benefits to JSW Steel in the form of a strong foothold in the eastern region, higher margins associated with value-added products and freight cost savings for iron ore procurement.

“JSW Steel’s US-based plate and pipe mill and its steel assets in the US and Italy acquired in FY2019 remained loss-making at the operating level in FY2020 and continue to face challenging environment in the current year due to the revised steel tariff policy in the US and a weak demand scenario in Italy,” the statement said.

Icra noted that a prolonged iron ore shortage in Odisha could heighten JSW Steel’s exposure to price risks related to iron ore and affect its profitability.

“While captive mines are expected to meet about 50% of JSW Steel’s total iron ore requirements by the end of FY2021 with the operationalisation of all four captive mines in Odisha and three captive mines in Karnataka in the current year, the company remains exposed to the volatility in coking coal prices,” the media statement said.

However, JSW Steel’s Dolvi plant’s proximity to the port and the Vijayanagar plant’s location in Bellary district of Karnataka with access to large iron ore deposits may result in significant freight cost savings for the company, Icra said.

The rating agency has also said that the overseas entities’ dependence on the parent company to partly meet its debt servicing requirements affects the consolidated financial position of JSW Steel."

“The average capacity utilisation was 89% during the month of November 2020. ” the company said in a statement on Tuesday.

The company’s flat products segment grew by 6% year-on-year to 9.61 lakh tonnes and the long products degrew by 1% to 2.95 lakh tonnes during November 2020, indicating a better demand in automotive and white goods segment as against construction segment.

JSW Steel has recorded a 7% year-on-year rise in crude Steel production for the month of October, 2020 at 13.38 lakh tonnes.

The utilisation levels in the month of October was also around 89% keeping November utilisation levels flat.

“The shortage of Iron ore remained a constraint in November 2020 to achieve higher capacity utilisation,’” the company said in a statement.

Steel industry is witnessing an acute iron ore shortage, one of the significant raw materials for making steel. Amid a sharp increase in iron ore prices, along with an improved domestic demand, Indian steel mills have hiked steel prices by around Rs 2500 - 2700 per tonne on 1st of December.

Newly acquired iron ore miners are yet to ramp up production leading to a supply shortage of iron ore, say analysts.

“Of the iron ore mines that were auctioned in Odisha, only some of them have been operationalised so far. Several bidders quoted unrealistic prices in the auction, and that may be one of the reasons behind this problem,” said Jayanta Roy, Icra’s senior vice president tracking the steel sector."
JSW Steel,"Dec 08, 2020, 07:00 PM IST",JSW & lenders working out compromise to complete BPSL deal,"JSW Steel's higher offer to complete the Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL) bankruptcy resolution is a part of a compromise formula being worked out by lenders and the Sajjan Jindal led steel company to ensure that the more than three year old transaction finally moves forward, multiple people involved in the negotiations said.

The bone of contention in the discussions is the Rs 1000 crore cash flows BPSL has generated between March and now which both parties do not want to let go. Also on the table is JSW's demand for an indemnity bond or a guarantee from lenders promising to return the full amount paid by JSW if the Supreme Court (SC) order goes against the company. The court is hearing a case involving the Enforcement Directorate (ED) investigation into allegations of fraud against the erstwhile promoters of BPSL. The ED is arguing that the new promoters of BPSL cannot be discharged from any prior liability of offences committed by the corporate debtor.

All these points are part of negotiations between the lenders and JSW. 

""This is a compromise formula being worked out. Technically the insolvency resolution period ended in March which was when the company was given to JSW but the litigation has delayed matters. The initial RFP is silent on what happens to cash flows generated by the company when the resolution period is over. Instead of fighting over it, JSW has put this proposal forward,"" said one of the persons involved in the negotiations.

JSW is offering another Rs 450 crore over and above the Rs 19,350 crore it has offered financial creditors. The company had bid Rs 19,700 crore for the 3.5 million tonne steel plant pipping Tata Steel's Rs 16,000 crore offer and was declared the winner by NCLT in September 2019. The additional offer will take the total bid amount by the company to Rs 20,150 crore of which Rs 350 crore will go to operational creditors. The company did not reply to an email seeking comment.

""An indemnity bond by lenders to JSW is also under consideration promising to give back the money in case the SC ruling is adverse. Similarly JSW is also considering signing a bond promising to give back the company to creditors if the deal does not go through,"" said another person involved in the negotiations.

The SC has not stayed the resolution process so far and the next hearing is only in January so both JSW and lenders want to ensure that they do not waste any time. 

BPSL was among the 12 large cases referred to bankruptcy courts by the RBI in 2017. The company owed lenders Rs 48,000 crore. Though under the terms under negotiations lenders still will take a 58% haircut the Rs 20,150 crore recovery could be the largest in some time as banks are struggling to recover bad loans due the economic recession caused by the Covid 19 pandemic.

With an improved offer JSW wants to capitalise on the two year high steel prices adding 3 million tonnes to the 18 million tonne existing capacity.

""It will take time since there are 36 creditors and many of them who need an okay from their headquarters to go ahead. But both parties are willing to move ahead which is a good sign,"" said the first person quoted above.

The core committee of creditors consists of lead bank Punjab National Bank (PNB), State Bank of India (SBI) and Acre ARC. They own more than 40% of BPSL's debt."

JSW Steel,"Dec 04, 2020, 10:57 AM IST",5 stocks from this sector doubled in 9 months. Worth a look?,"With a stellar run in stocks so far this financial year, the metals pack has managed to outperform the benchmark equity indices till date. The superior performance of metal stocks in FY21 cab largely be attributed to rising domestic steel prices and muted coal cost, which led to earnings upgrades.

Market watchers say the momentum is likely to continue, and cite inexpensive valuation amid a demand-supply mismatch for this. The BSE Metal Index has rallied 82 per cent since the beginning of this financial year, with Jindal Steel & Power (JSPL) rallying the most at 208 per cent.

JSW Steel (up 144 per cent), Hindalco (up 140 per cent), Tata Steel (up 117 per cent) and SAIL (up 117 per cent) have been among the other major gainers from this sector.

Other metal stocks – including Nalco, Hindustan Zinc and Vedanta – have gained between 35 per cent and 90 per cent between April 1 and December 1. BSE Sensex has risen nearly 52 per cent during this period.

The sequential recovery in demand and lagging supply have raised steel prices across the world over the past two months, with prices rising 35 per cent in the US, 15 per cent in Europe, 13 per cent in Asia excluding China and 6 per cent in China.

In India, domestic steel producers tool Rs 3,000 per tonne price hike in November 2020, which raised total hike in average price in Q2FY21 by 20 per cent. Traders expect another Rs 2,000 per tonne price hike in December 2020, raising domestic hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices to a record high of Rs 48,000 per tonne.

Spreads on Indian steel have risen around 25 per cent in Q3FY21 and are hovering at a three-year high. Brokerage Motilal Oswal Financial Services believes the spreads should stay strong on the back of domestic demand recovery and higher regional prices.

In general, the commodity-product spread is the difference between the price of raw material and the price of a finished product created from that commodity.

“We expect margins to expand to record high levels in Q3FY21 led by strong prices, muted cost of coal and continued earnings upgrades,” Kotak said, adding that it has raised Ebitda estimates for steel companies by 8-12 per cent for FY2021E and 2-4 per cent for FY2022E.

All major components of the BSE Metal index posted profits for Q2FY21, which was an antithesis of the gloom and scare seen in the previous quarter. Barring JSPL, which posted a Rs 706 crore loss for September quarter, other metal majors reported profits ranging from Rs 100 crore to Rs 3,000 crore.

“Management commentaries in Q2FY21 were equivocally optimistic across companies. Going forward, we expect more earnings upgrades as Dalal Street takes cognizance of improved earnings outlook,” Edelweiss Securities said.

Kotak believes stocks in the ferrous space are trading below their historic mean on both EV/Ebitda and price-to-book basis and offer prospects for attractive upside despite the recent rally. The brokerage is positive on Tata Steel and JSPL.

Motilal Oswal prefers longs over flats in the steel sector, as it expects India rebar prices to be strong, led by a seasonal (post-monsoon) uptick in construction activity.

“Our analysis of pricing trends for last 10 years suggests longs have outperformed flats by around Rs 1,500 per tonne on an average in the second half of the financial year,” the brokerage said.

Motilal Oswal likes JSPL and JSW Steel with price targets of Rs 307 and Rs 413, respectively.

However, it has a neutral rating on Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India with price targets of Rs 604 and Rs 49, respectively."

The company had offered to pay Rs 19,350 crore to the financial creditors, with the lenders taking nearly a 60% haircut on the dues. Apart from this, JSW had offered to pay Rs 350 crore to operational creditors against their admitted claims of Rs 700 crore.

However, it failed to conclude the deal after the Enforcement Directorate attached an estimated Rs 4,000 crore worth of Bhushan Power & Steel’s assets in Odisha under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. JSW Steel had sought immunity from all these cases.

JSW Steel said earlier that it expected the Supreme Court to give its final verdict at the earliest in the Bhushan Power & Steel insolvency case to help it conclude the deal before 2021. Meanwhile, the company has already completed acquisitions of two other bankrupt firms, Monnet Ispat and Asian Colour Coated."

As per industry sources, JSW Steel and JSPL have hiked prices by Rs 2,500 - Rs 2,700 per tonne and ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel (AMNS) have raised prices by around Rs 2,500 - Rs 2,750 per tonne effective from 1st of December.

“This is due to three factors - international prices are up, domestic demand has improved since Q2 after it nosedived in Q1, and rising iron ore prices due to supply shortage"", said Jayanta Roy, Icra’s senior vice president tracking the steel sector.

As per analysts domestic hot-rolled coil prices are quoting at a two-year high of Rs 47,000 - Rs 47,500 per tonne. Rebars are at a similar level. Prices of wire rod is quoting around Rs 48,000 to 49,000 per tonne, whereas special steels are up to Rs 49,000 per tonne.

“We have also increased prices along with other steel players. Today our HRC price is around Rs 47,500 - 47,650 per tonne in Chennai, Mumbai and Delhi. We are in-par with the International prices and with Iron ore prices inching up we are forced to hike prices,” said Jindal Steel and Power’s managing director, V.R. Sharma to ET.

Last in 2008, steel prices reached an all time high of Rs 60,000 per tonne. The current trend shows that the prices are going up to the higher level bracket, added Sharma.

Steel companies had been hiking prices for the past four months and in November alone prices have been raised by around Rs 2000 per tonne. 

According to analysts, in the last three months, steel prices have gone up around Rs 5000 per tonne. Along with this, intentional prices have gone up in the US by 42%, EU prices are up 25%, Japan and South Korea by around 10-11% and China has gone up by 5%.

“International prices are high, our prices are still at a discount. Odisha iron ore miners have increased prices by more than 100%, in the last three months and it is at Rs 6,450 per tonne,” said Amit Dixit, research analyst, Edelweiss Institutional Equities.

 NMDC has also hiked following the Odisha players, Dixit added.

State-owned iron ore producer NMDC is also mulling over another hike in December, sources said. 

Newly acquired iron ore miners are yet to ramp up production leading to a supply shortage, say analysts.

“Of the iron ore mines that were auctioned in Odisha, only some of them have been operationalised so far. Several bidders quoted unrealistic prices in the auction, and that may be one of the reasons behind this problem,” added ICRA’s Roy.

The current supply shortage with the improving demand is likely to drive HRC prices. Steel mills could further increase prices in December 2020, with December – March being the peak period for the steel sector each year, said India Ratings in a research report, titled Steel Monitor: High Gross Steel Spreads Likely to Improve EBITDA over 3QFY21, on Tuesday.

However, steel players are also witnessing a surge in domestic demand from Infra and auto sectors.

“Demand is of course up. Without a demand pick up, steel companies will not be able to hike prices,” Edelweiss’ Dixit said. 

The unleashing of pent-up demand post the lockdown has contributed to the price recovery. Prices have sustained due to a strong rural construction demand, said Ind-Ra's report."

To aid the supply of oxygen in the country, Union Minister of Steel Dharmendra Pradhan in September had directed steel plants to start supplying liquid medical oxygen (LMO), which is a crucial medical requirement for a coronavirus patient. 

The steel ministry had also made operational a portal wherein plant-wise information regarding availability of oxygen and daily supply by various plants and states to which such supplies have been made is provided. ""Integrated steel plants (ISPs) in the public and private sector have been supplying LMO to meet the requirement of oxygen in hospitals across the country. 56,446.245 MT (metric tonne) LMO was supplied by steel plants to various states during the period from September 11, 2020 to October 31, 2020,"" the ministry said in an update. However, the ministry did not provide names of plants and companies that are engaged in work of supplying oxygen. 

 According to the statement, 37,364 tonne LMO was supplied by private sector units and 19,081.47 tonne by Steel CPSEs. Majority supply was made to three states of Karnataka (14,251.9 tonne), Andhra Pradesh (7,467 tonne) and Maharashtra (7,332.6 MT). This contribution is in addition to what the steel plants made in jointly fighting the COVID-19 spread in the country.

JSW Steel,"Nov 30, 2020, 08:01 AM IST","JSW, Jindal Steel are Motilal Oswal’s top sectoral picks on growth outlook","MUMBAI: Jindal Steel & Power and JSW Steel are the most preferred picks of Motilal Oswal Securities in the steel sector due to their strong margins and potential to deliver higher volume growth in the medium term.

Motilal Oswal has a target price of ₹307 on Jindal Steel and ₹413 on JSW Steel, which implies a potential upside of 25.7 per cent and 17.8 per cent from their current market prices.

Shares of Jindal Steel ended down 2.1 per cent at ₹244.30 on Friday after hitting a 52-week high of ₹252.35 during the day. JSW Steel ended down 2.4 per cent at ₹350.50.

The brokerage expects Jindal Steel and Power to log an 11 per cent compounded annual growth in volumes over the FY20-FY22 which will help the company drive a 20 per cent compounded annual growth in operating profit (EBITDA) excluding Oman.

On JSW Steel, the brokerage said it likes the company given its strong project pipeline and cost reduction initiatives.

Overall the brokerage is positive on the sector as steel spreads are at a multi-year high and improved demand has supported absorption of price hikes.

Motilal Oswal has raised the estimates of the operating profit on Indian steel companies by 3-12 per cent for the ongoing financial year and by 5-13 per cent for the FY22 period as the spreads on steel are currently at a three -year high.

The brokerage said the steel spreads are likely to stay strong on the back of domestic demand recovery and higher regional prices.

The higher steel spreads should lead to an even bigger improvement in the EBITDA per tonne on improving sales mix, said Motilal Oswal.

The brokerage said domestic hot-rolled coil prices have increased by ₹4,500 per tonne in November to ₹47,000 per tonne on a strong recovery in demand for flat steel, backed by a demand recovery in end-use sectors like automotive and white goods, among others.

The price hikes have been well supported by higher regional steel prices, said Motilal Oswal."
JSW Steel,"Nov 29, 2020, 01:53 PM IST",JSW Steel in the process of acquiring land for steel plant in Odisha: Director Jayant Acharya,"NEW DELHI: Domestic steel major JSW Steel is in the process of acquiring land at Jagatsinghpur in Odisha where it has proposed to set up a 13.2 MTPA greenfield steel plant, a top company official said. 

 Speaking to PTI, JSW Steel Director - Commercial Marketing and Corporate Strategy Jayant Acharya said it is the same site near the port of Paradip where POSCO was keen to set up a 12 MTPA steel plant. 

 The Odisha government and POSCO had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in this regard in 2005. However, the South Korean steel giant had to abandon its proposed Rs 52,000-crore project due to multiple reasons from delay in environmental clearances to protests by locals. 

 The pact ultimately expired in 2010 and was not renewed again. 

 ""We have plans to expand through both acquisitions and brownfield expansions and then followed by greenfield (project) if we are looking in terms of Odisha,"" Acharya said. 

 The company plans to set up an integrated steel plant of 13.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) capacity in Odisha along with a 900 MW power plant for captive usage with an investment amount of Rs 53,700 crore. 

 Replying to a question on land acquisition for setting up the project, Acharya said, ""We have already identified that (land) and the acquisition of that land is going on. Along with the Odisha government...we are doing...the land acquisition part."" 

 It is the same land where POSCO was earlier looking to set a 12 MTPA steel plant, he said. 

 However, Acharya didn't provide a timeline for completion of land acquisition process. 

 The process is on and such processes take some time, he said. 

 ""Whatever necessary allocations are coming to us which are ready for payment we would be doing that,"" Acharya added. 

 JSW Group had approached the Odisha government for land after POSCO shelved its plan to set up the steel plant. Subsequently, all statutory clearances given to POSCO were transferred to JSW Steel. 

 Last year in December, the hearing for the company's project was conducted. 

 ""JSW's hearing was conducted peacefully and successfully. That is a huge development. The integrated project has been passed unopposed with almost the same investment that POSCO was looking for...We expect the work to start soon on the Rs 53,700 crore project,"" IPICOL Managing Director Nitin B Jawale had said.

Index: Nifty 
Nifty extended its bullish momentum with indicators turning overbought on a daily time frame. RSI at 75 suggests that the index is in extremely bullish territory and a pause or a correction from the 13,100 level towards 12,750 should be an opportunity to go long. Bank Nifty, too, is on the verge of breaching above 29,800, a resistance level, above which the index can go towards an all-time high.

HCL Tech,"Nov 24, 2020, 03:50 PM IST","TCS, Infy, Lupin, Zee among 24 stocks looking strong for a rally","NEW DELHI: As Nifty50 hit the psychologically important 13,000 mark for the first time, at least two dozen stocks in the broader market – including four IT biggies and a handful of pharma stocks – are looking strong on the technical charts, as suggested by moving average convergence divergence, or MACD.

The momentum indicator signalled bullish crossovers — a sign of bullish undertone — in 24 counters, hinting at possible upsides in the days ahead.

The list included IT majors TCS, Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies, besides pharma names Lupin, Ipca Laboratories, Laurus Labs and Vivimed Labs. Zee Entertainment, Torrent Power, Infibeam Avenues, CG Power, Abbott India, Dalmia Bharat Sugar and Kitex Garments were among other stocks sending out bullish signals on their daily charts.




MACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal line’, is plotted on top of the MACD chart to indicate ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

There are 14 stocks showing bearish trends. They included Ashok Leyland, Axis Bank, TVS Motor, City Union Bank, Salasar Technologies and Deccan Cements, among others.


The MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

This is because MACD is a trend-following indicator. Though traders can increase the sensitivity of the MACD by using shorter-term moving averages for computing MACD (e.g. 5-day and 12-day moving averages), the lag effect will still be there. Traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

On Tuesday, Nifty50 traded 1 per cent higher near the 13,050 mark.

“On the daily time frame, Nifty continues to display a very strong trend, as the ADX remains at elevated levels and the MACD is in the ‘buy’ mode. When Nifty is in a trend, avoid selling short for the time being. A break above the 13,000 level should propel the index higher towards 13,084 level. There is a strong likelihood that Nifty will trade higher going into the last three days of the F&O series,” said independent analyst Manish Shah.

Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities advised traders to go long on Nifty50 above 12,970 level for targets of 13,100 and 13,180 levels. “Below 12,800 level, the index would gradually fall to 12600 level,” he said.

Understanding MACD
A close look at the stock chart of TCS shows whenever the MACD line has breached above the signal line, the stock has shown an uptrend and vice versa. On Tuesday, the scrip traded at Rs 2,736, up 0.43 per cent."

HCL Tech,"Nov 17, 2020, 12:35 PM IST","Team Prashant Jain at HDFC AMC cut stakes in RIL, TaMo and 24 other Nifty stocks in October","HDFC Asset Management lightened its positions in at least 26 Nifty stocks in October, as their valuations hit the sky amid the ongoing market rally from the March lows.

The 50-share Nifty had gained 55 per cent to 11,642 till October 30 from its 52-week low of 7,511 hit on March 24. Optically, Dalal Street is not in the comfort zone, considering Nifty’s price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 34.48 times as of October 12 against a 10-year average of 22.55 times.

The country’s second-largest money manager reduced exposure to a couple of outperformers over the past eight months, including in Reliance Industries, whose share price has rallied 120 per cent since March lows. HDFC AMC sold 6.57 lakh shares of the energy-to-telecom behemoth.

The fund house also cut its holdings in other Nifty companies such as JSW Steel, Cipla, Tata Motors, Wipro, UPL, Dr Reddy’s Labs, Tech Mahindra, Adani Ports, HDFC Bank, Tata Steel, Bajaj Auto, Britannia Industries, Asian Paints, Titan, BPCL, Bajaj Finance, L&T and HDFC, among others.

Shares of these companies have gained between 28 per cent and 110 per cent between March 24 and October 30.

On the other hand, the fund house raised its holdings in underperformers such as Coal India, Bharti Airtel and SBI. Coal India shares have declined over 10 per cent since March, while those of Airtel and SBI have gained 7 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively, till October 30.

“Large banks with good technology platforms will experience market share gains. Some of the banks are indeed trading cheap and some of the high quality bank stocks are trading at reasonable multiples, but they are clearly growing businesses. Over time, there should be some returns out there as well,” Jain said.

“We should value banks on price-to-book value multiples and on sustainable ROEs. In that context, some of the large PSU bank stocks are virtually free because when you adjust the value of the subsidiaries, the non-banking finance subsidiaries, the price to book value multiples are actually extremely low. There is considerable value in some of the bank stocks, which are trading at virtually zero price to book value multiples,” he said.

Sector wise, the fund house added Sun Pharma, Lupin and Syngene International from the pharma space, even as it purchased additional shares of Hindalco and Mishra Dhatu Nigam from the metals space.

In his latest interaction with ETNOW, ED & CIO Prashant Jain said cyclical stocks, capex-oriented companies, banks, multinationals have lagged this recovery and that is where valuations are looking more reasonable. “That would probably play out now,” he said.

Transport Corporation of India, REC, Cholamandalam Investment & Finance, Tata Consumer Products, TCS, ONGC, HCL Technologies, Endurance Technologies, DLF, Bharat Electronics, Hero MotoCorp, HPCL, Maruti Suzuki and SBI Life are among other players in which HDFC AMC bought 1 lakh to 20 lakh additional shares in October.

Jain said conditions look good for home sales, auto sales, capex and credit growth. “If all of these things materialise, then everything from steel, cement, paints will start growing. However, one should not ignore the valuations,” he said.

Overall, the fund house raised exposure to at least 68 stocks last month, but cut it in 107 others. Some of this buying or selling may have been done for HDFC MF’s passively-managed index funds.

In the broader market, the fund house completely exited stocks like Bharat Forge, Chemcon Speciality Chemicals, Dabur India, EIH- Rights Entitlements, MRF, NMDC and Sun TV.

Its fresh buys during the month included Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail, Cyient, Dixon Technologies, Finolex Cables, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Piramal Enterprises and SAIL, among others, data available with Ace Mutual Fund showed."
HCL Tech,"Nov 14, 2020, 06:36 PM IST",What to expect from Muhurat trading 2020 and top stocks to buy,"India’s top stock bourses BSE and NSE will conduct the customary Muhurat trading session on Diwali this Saturday between 6 pm to 7.35 pm. The timings of the session are decided based on planetary positions, and traders continue with their age-old tradition of doing customary trading on the occasion, which is also marks the first day of the Hindu accounting calendar, Samvat.

The occasion is also deemed auspicious to start new business activity and the bourses and business houses are decked up with diyas and colourful rangoli patterns.

NSE said trading will kick off at 6:15 pm and last till 7:15 pm on November 14. There will be a pre-open Muhurat session from 6 pm to 6:08 pm and a post-closing session between 7:25 pm and 7:35 pm.

Traditionally, the market has shown a positive bias during the Muhurat trading session. BSE benchmark Sensex has closed in the positive in nine out of last 12 Muhurat trading sessions since 2008. On Friday, Sensex ended Samvat 2076 at 43,443 and Nifty50 at 12,720.

BSE benchmark Sensex gained 192 points, or 0.49 per cent, to 32,250 in last year’s Muhurat trading session. On October 28, 2008, the Diwali day, Sensex soared 5.86 per cent in a single session to settle at 9,008.

In other years, Nifty has remained in a narrow range of 0.5 per cent. Only in the years 2012 (down 0.28 per cent), 2016 (down 0.04 per cent) and 2017 (down 0.60 per cent), did the 30-share index close lower in Muhurat trading.


Samvat 2077 projections
Analysts from a dozen brokerages that took part in the ETMarkets’ pre-Diwali Survey said Sensex could rise up to 47,000 level and Nifty50 to 14,000 by next Diwali.

AK Prabhakar of IDBI Capital Markets set a target of 45,000 for Sensex and 13,000 for Nifty by the end of Samvat 2077.

Narendra Solanki, Head of Equity Research at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers, said given the consensus forecast for Nifty50 earnings and the underlying recovery expectations, one can look at a Nifty target of 14,400 by next Diwali. Based on price-to-book value forecast, Nifty50 target for next Diwali stands at 13,700, he said.

“A level of around 14,000 on Nifty thus looks achievable by next Diwali. For Sensex, the target should be about 47,000,” he said.


Stocks to buy in Muhurat Trading Session

Here are the top picks for Diwali from various brokerage houses:

ICICI Bank | Target price: Rs 530ICICI Bank is well placed in the current scenario to gain market share across loans, deposits and revenues on the back of its funding position and product offerings. IIFL Securities expects loan growth of 12 CAGR over FY 20-23 E aided by higher growth in the retail loans. Gradual run down of excess liquidity and an increase in retail loan mix would aid NIMs going forward. (recommended by IIFL Securities)


HCL Technologies | Target price: Rs 1,000The brokerage believes that HCL’s portfolio is relatively insulated against peers as it has the lower concentration to verticals like travel, energy, hospitality and higher exposure to low impact verticals like BFSI healthcare and technology Moreover, it has 37 exposure to IMS (resilient service line) where it has strong partnerships and capabilities that can enable it to capitalise on opportunities in areas of cloud migration and network security. (recommended by IIFL Securities)


Ashok Leyland | Target price (2-year): Rs 101Market share in the Medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCV) segment continues to remain more or less stable over the years. Therefore, it doesn’t have a higher risk of any new launch by the competitor taking away big chunk of shares, unlike passenger vehicles. Moreover, pricing discipline is broadly maintained unlike aggressive pricing by the two-wheelers players. Thus, the competitive pressure for the M&HCV industry is the least, in our view. Ashok Leyland has strategised its light commercial vehicles business to gain market share with new products and segments. (recommended by Reliance Securities)


Bharat Forge | Target price (2-year): Rs 551Strong rebound in automobile business post a major slump and strong double-digit growth in high-margin engineering business will be the biggest triggers for Bharat Forge’s earnings and valuation re-rating close to engineering conglomerates, going forward. Its standalone and consolidated margin is expected to improve by 420 basis points and 510 basis points over FY20-23E, respectively. (recommended by Reliance Securities)


HDFC AMC | Target price (2-year): Rs 3,250HDFC AMC has delivered an enviable earnings growth (22 per cent CAGR) over the last 7 years and gained investors’ trust on account of strong banking parentage. Going forward, with strong corporate governance, brand equity, pan-India distribution and a steady stream of SIP flows, HDFCAMC is likely to see continued traction. (recommended by Reliance Securities)


KPR Mill | Target price: Rs 1,105KPR Mill can be a potential beneficiary of the emerging global trend of CHINA+1 policy owing to its strong presence across the textile value chain. Global brands typically scout for companies having vertical presence since they have better quality control checks, and adherence to timely delivery. Also, global players emphasises on robust business ethics, obedience to global and industry norms, fair labour practice and other social aspects. YES Securities believes that KPR Mill with effective management skills and efficient operational capabilities fulfils required business and social parameters. The company also enjoys competitive advantages such as favourable transport cost. (recommended by Yes Securities)


Manappuram Finance | Target price: Rs 225The latest price correction was driven by concerns stemming from tonnage de‐growth in Q1 FY21 and higher LTVs allowed to banks. However, the concurrent positive trends in collateral and customer acquisition should allay these investor concerns. Increasing share of gold loans and its rising profitability fortifies MGFL’s already strong capital and funding/liquidity position. (recommended by Yes Securities)


Kansai Nerolac Paints | Target price: Rs 700YES Securities is bullish on Kansai Nerolac backed by expected improvements in structural drivers such as the shift towards the organised sector, housing push in semi‐urban and rural areas, shorter painting cycles, governments focus on increasing rural income and increased consumer awareness in rural areas. Lower raw material prices to aid in higher gross margins and most part of negative impact on account of lower absorption of fixed costs would be negated by higher GM’s for remaining part of FY21. The brokerage expects ROE to move to reach 17 per cent by FY23E. (recommended by Yes Securities)


Mahindra & Mahindra | Target price: Rs 800YES Securities is positive on M&M backed by its efficient operations gained via a strong focus on cost optimisation, value engineering, improved supply chain management, productivity improvements, and exploitation of synergies between various group businesses. (recommended by Yes Securities)


Crisil | Target price: Rs 2,600YES Securities is positive on Crisil due to its strong foothold in ratings industry, above average growth rate compared to GDP, presence into the risk‐free non-lending business, high entry barriers, asset-light business with debt-free balance sheet, better pricing power compared to peers due to a stronger brand and high profitability ratios. (recommended by Yes Securities)


Bharti Airtel | Target price: Rs 650Bharti’s execution has been top-notch in the last few quarters, evident from strong 16% India Mobile EBITDA growth cumulatively in the last two quarters. Robust 10m subscriber adds lead to cumulative ARPU improvement of 5 per cent. (by Motilal Oswal Financial Services)


State Bank of India | Target price: Rs 300The earnings normalisation cycle for SBI has begun and it remains the best play among the PSU banks, on gradual recovery in the Indian economy, with a healthy PCR of 71 per cent, robust capitalisation, a strong liability franchise, and improved core operating profitability. (by Motilal Oswal Financial Services)


Hero MotoCorp | Target price: Rs 3700The two-wheeler major is poised for faster recovery over other two-wheeler peers due to its rural-focused portfolio and market leadership in the entry and executive segments. Considering its improved competitive positioning post BS6, the auto major should continue to see good demand with its economy-executive focused portfolio. (by Motilal Oswal Financial Services)


Dabur India | Target price: Rs 600Dabur’s investment case is strong, supported by: (a) dedicated focus on the Herbal segment, (b) power brand strategy, (c) a spate of new launches, (d) an increasing direct distribution reach and (e) cost savings which would be plowed back into the business.

HCL Tech,"Nov 13, 2020, 11:33 AM IST",Nifty stocks that gained up to 90% & those that finished Samvat 2076 as top laggards,"Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and wealth, blessed 23 Nifty50 companies with double-digit returns since last Diwali.

On top of the list, pharma majors Divi’s Laboratories and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories gained 91 per cent and 75 per cent, respectively, during Samvat 2076, which ends of November 14. BSE benchmark Sensex gained 11 per cent during this period. Cipla and Sun Pharmaceutical have gained 61 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively.

The Samvat year gone by remained highly volatility for equity investors. Dalal Street saw the indices rise till January 2020, before they saw a sharp drop due to panic selling on Covid breakout. Robust liquidity and better-than-expected Q2 earnings eventually helped the indices come back to their all-time high levels.

Analysts say the momentum is likely to stay strong for domestic equities in Samvat 2077.

“The 14,000 level looks achievable for Nifty by next Diwali, while Sensex should be around 47,000,” says Narendra Solanki, Head of Equity Research (Fundamental), Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

HCL Tech,"Oct 16, 2020, 05:52 PM IST",Market Movers: Unseasonal spurt in AC stocks; 15 stocks in overbought zone,"Shares of Amber Enterprises, Voltas, Blue Star and Johnson Control-Hitachi hogged the limelight on Friday after the government banned import of air conditioners. IT major HCL Technologies kept buzzing after delivering better-than-expected financial results for September quarter. However, the scrip ended the day in the red.

Overall, the benchmark equity indices recovered from the big losses suffered in the previous session, with banking and financial stocks leading the rally. The 30-share BSE Sensex settled 0.64 per cent up at 39,982, while the 50-share Nifty closed 0.70 per cent higher at 11,762.

Joseph Thomas, Head of Research at Emkay Wealth Management, said, “After Thursday’s storm all major markets, the domestic market remained calm today. But factors that are providing ammunition to the intermittent volatility still remain active and potent.”


That said, here is a lowdown on what happened in Friday’s session:
IDBI Bank shares soarShares of IDBI Bank rallied nearly 16 per cent to Rs 38 after a report that the government would seek in-principle approval from the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on lowering its 47.11 per cent stake in IDBI Bank, after which the structure of the sale will be determined.


AC stocks rallyShares of Amber Enterprises rallied nearly 9 per cent to Rs 2,180 after the government imposed a ban on the import of air conditioners with refrigerants. Voltas, Johnson Control-Hitachi Air Conditioning, Blue Star also advanced between 4-5 per cent to Rs 700, Rs 2,278 and Rs 637, respectively.


It’s sell on news for HCL TechDespite encouraging Q2 results, shares of the IT major declined over 3 per cent to Rs 827, but analysts brushed it off as a sell-on-news scenario and advised investors to focus on long-term growth. HCL Tech shares are up more than 40 per cent on a year-to-date basis. The company reported 18.5 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth in net profit at Rs 3,142 crore for September quarter against analysts’ estimate of Rs 3,033 crore.


HDFC Bank gains ahead of resultsShares of HDFC Bank advanced 2.55 per cent to Rs 1,199 ahead of its earnings for the quarter ended September 30. Brokerage IIFL Securities said asset quality of the bank is likely to remain stable QoQ and gross non-performing assets may stand at 1.40 per cent. It expects 17 per cent YoY growth in net profit, 15 per cent rise in pre-provision profit and 18 per cent expansion in net interest income.


Broader indices outperformBuying was not limited to index stock alone, but small and midcaps also witnessed good interest from market participants. The BSE Midcap index rose 1.05 per cent, aided by gains in IDBI Bank, Kansai Nerolac and Jindal Steel and Power, while the BSE Smallcap index added 0.97 per cent on buying in Alankit, Mahindra EPC Irrigation and Avadh Sugar.

On the other hand, HCL Technologies (Rs 2,423 crore), Reliance Industries (Rs 2,188 crore), Infosys (Rs 2,054 crore) and Bajaj Finance (Rs 1,640 crore) stood among most active in terms of value.


Where is Nifty headed?Nifty formed a small bullish body with a long lower shadow after taking support at the previous day’s low of 11,660 making a double bottom at this crucial support zone. Aditya Agarwala, Senior Technical Analyst, YES Securities, said if the bulls manage to take the index beyond the crucial resistance of 11,800, then a short-covering rally would extend it to 11,870-11,935 levels. But if the bears manage to push the index below the key support at 11,660 level, then fresh selling pressure may drag it to 11,600-11,550 levels."

Rates are now at the highest level since September 2018.

In 17 days, the petrol price has gone up by Rs 2.35 per litre and diesel rate has risen by Rs 3.15.

Brent crude oil has risen 34 per cent from USD 36.9 per barrel on October 30 to USD 49.5 on December 4 - the last trading day - on hopes that COVID-19 vaccines would lead to demand recovery.

 ICICI Securities said vaccine hopes are driving oil prices up. 

 Brent crude oil is up 34 per cent from lows in end-October 2020 driven by hope that COVID-19 vaccines would lead to demand recovery. 

 ""The oil price surge is despite a second wave of Covid in Europe and US (which has led to demand recovery reversal), and surge in Libyan oil output from 0.1 million barrels per day (bpd) to 1.25 million bpd,"" it said. 

 Oil cartel OPEC plus its allies like Russia, (called OPEC+), deciding to raise output from January 2021 more modestly than earlier agreed is likely to ensure global supply deficit even in the first quarter of 2021. ""Thus, OPEC+ has done its part to prevent supply surplus until the vaccine boosts demand,"" it added. 

 Brent has risen from USD 36.9 per barrel on October 30 to USD 49.5 on December 4. 

 IEA estimates the global oil supply deficit at 2.1-2.8 million bpd in Q3-Q4 calendar year 2020. However, a surplus of 0.4 million was likely in Q1 2021 if OPEC+, as agreed in April 2020, was to prune output cuts from 7.7 million bpd to 5.8 million bpd from January. 

 ""However, we now estimate supply deficit of 0.5 million bpd in Q1 2021 and 0.2-2.8 million bpd in Q2-Q4 as OPEC+ has decided to raise output by just 0.5 million bpd in January 2021 and by not more than 0.5 million bpd in later months and only after deliberations,"" ICICI Securities said.

Indian Oil Corp,"Dec 03, 2020, 07:34 AM IST",Ahead of Market: 12 things that will decide stock action on Thursday,"Nifty made a strong comeback after a bout of profit booking and managed to close in the green on Wednesday.

The headline index formed a hanging man candle for the second consecutive day signalling that the market players are sceptical of the 50-pack's run, clinching all-time highs repeatedly for the past one month. Failing to breach its month-long resistance levels and increasing volatility can lead to further profit booking. 

According to Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC Securities, the short-term trend of Nifty continues to be positive with rangebound action. “The market is expected to face stiff resistance around 13,150 or slightly higher in the coming sessions. A sustainable move above this area could open some more upside for the market,” said Shetti.

While formation of hanging man after a reasonable up move is considered as a warning signal for reversal of trend post confirmation, however, since this pattern is formed amidst a range-bound movement, the immediate negative implication could be doubtful, analysts said.

“We’re seeing consolidation in the index but the bias is still on the positive side. Going ahead, further updates on Covid vaccines and cues from the global markets will remain in focus. Besides, on the domestic front, RBI’s monetary policy meet would also be on investors' radar. The MPC is likely to maintain the status quo. However, their commentary on growth and inflation would be critical,” said Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking.


That said, here's a look at what some of the key indicators are suggesting for Thursday's action:US shares slip as monthly private payrolls disappoint
Wall Street fell on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq retreating from the record levels hit in the previous session as fewer-than-expected private job additions in November added to concerns about the near-term pressure on the economy. At 09:48 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 125.87 points, or 0.43%, to 29,698.05 and the S&P 500 lost 15.71 points, or 0.44%, to 3,646.36.


Europe European shares dip as investors take a pauseEuropean shares slipped on Wednesday as investors took stock following a near 14% rally last month, while shares in BioNTech surged after UK became the first country to approve its COVID-19 vaccine developed with Pfizer. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.26%, with auto stocks leading declines as carmaker Volkswagen slipped 2.1% amid uncertainty about top management.


Tech view: Nifty forms 'Dragonfly Doji'Nifty50 tested the 13,000 level on Wednesday, before rebounding and closing in the black. The index formed a Dragonfly Doji pattern on the daily chart, suggesting a balance of power between the bulls and the bears. Analysts said the 12,800 level would remain a major support for the index in the coming days, but if it takes out the record high of 13,145 level, it would send out a signal of strength for the index. Nifty50 seems to be in a no-trade zone, as is evident from the fact that neither the bulls nor the bears were being able to have an upper hand by the end of the session, said Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in.

For years, ExxonMobil has sat on the sidelines evaluating business opportunities in the Indian upstream, seeking an easier policy framework and studying geological data for a possible bid for exploration acreage. Last year it tied up with ONGC, India’s largest state-run oil and gas producer, for a possible joint bidding for exploration licenses. Exxon has yet to make a bid for an exploration license in India.




“Exxon Mobil is in active discussion with some of our companies to participate in some of our producing fields,” Pradhan said without elaborating. The move to forge a partnership for some producing fields surprised many as India hadn’t so far offered a stake in big producing fields that can attract the likes of ExxonMobil and the marginal producing fields that had been offered by ONGC and Oil India hadn’t attracted big oil firms.

A deal between ExxonMobil and Indian producers may mean a big shift in the government’s policy. In recent years, the emphasis in government’s policy has been on drawing foreign investors to exploration acreages, not big producing fields.

Pradhan told an industry gathering last month that domestic oil and gas companies should function like holding companies, farming out their projects and involving global players with advanced technologies to speed up execution.

Indian upstream sector has witnessed limited interest from foreign players despite a slew of policy changes the government has introduced in recent years. British giant BP has been the sole foreign bidder for exploration license under the revamped bidding rounds in the last few years – it along with Reliance Industries bid for just one block.

 Diesel rates went up from Rs 71.86 to Rs 72.13 per litre. 

 This is the eighth increase in rates since November 20 when oil companies resumed daily price revision after nearly two-week hiatus. 

 In nine days, petrol price has gone up by Rs 1.07 per litre and diesel rate has risen by Rs 1.67.

""Subsidy on LPG is paid to consumers directly and not to any company. So the ownership of the company that sells LPG is not of any material consequence,"" Pradhan told . 

 The government gives 12 cooking gas (LPG) cylinders of 14.2-kg each to households in a year at a subsidised rate. This subsidy is directly paid into the bank accounts of the users. 

 The subsidy is paid in advance and consumers use this to buy LPG refills that are available only at market price from dealers of oil marketing companies -- Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), BPCL and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL). 

 The moment a refill is bought using the subsidy, another installment is transferred into the user bank accounts. 

 Pradhan said the LPG subsidy payment is done digitally to all verified customers. 

 ""Since it is paid directly to consumers, it does not matter if the servicing company is public sector or private sector,"" he said. ""LPG subsidy will continue as before to BPCL consumers even after disinvestment."" 

 The government is selling its entire 53 per cent stake along with management control in BPCL. The new owner will get 15.33 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and 22 per cent of the fuel marketing share. 

 It also owns 17,355 petrol pumps, 6,159 LPG distributor agencies and 61 out of 256 aviation fuel stations in the country. 

 BPCL services 7.3 crore out of 28.5 crore LPG consumers in the country. 

 ""All these will continue to get a government subsidy,"" Pradhan said. 

 Asked if the consumers of BPCL will after some years be transferred to IOC and HPCL, he said there is no such proposal as of now. 

 ""When we pay a subsidy to consumers directly, the ownership does not come in the way,"" he said. 

 Privatisation of BPCL is part of plans to raise a record Rs 2.1 lakh crore from disinvestment proceeds in 2020-21 (April 2020 to March 2021). 

 BPCL operates four refineries in Mumbai (Maharashtra), Kochi (Kerala), Bina (Madhya Pradesh), and Numaligarh (Assam) with a combined capacity of 38.3 million tonnes per annum, which is 15.3 per cent of India's total refining capacity of 249.8 million tonnes. 

 While the Numaligarh refinery will be carved out of BPCL and sold to a PSU, the new buyer of the company will get 35.3 million tonnes of refining capacity -- 12 million tonnes Mumbai unit, 15.5 million tonnes Kochi refinery and 7.8 million tonnes Bina unit."
Indian Oil Corp,"Nov 26, 2020, 08:17 PM IST",Oil regulator PNGRB simplifies gas pipeline tariff,"New Delhi: Oil regulator PNGRB has simplified the country's gas pipeline tariff structure to make the fuel more affordable for distant users and to attract investment for building gas infrastructure. The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has notified regulations for a 'unified' tariff structure for over a dozen pipelines that form the National Gas Grid which will lead to a 20-30 per cent rise in transportation charges paid by users near the source but a reduction for consumers in the hinterland. 

 ""Unified tariff shall be determined by the Board in respect of the national gas grid system for each financial year before the start of such financial year,"" it said. 

 Currently, the tariff is levied in proportion to the distance transported - the longer the distance, the higher is the charge. This resulted in consumers away from the coast paying higher charges as compared to those near it. 

 PNGRB has now notified a two-zone tariff structure - Zone-1 will be 300-km from the source of gas (gas field or LNG import terminal) and Zone-II will be beyond that. 

 PNGRB said the tariff for the first tariff zone will be 40 per cent of the tariff for the second zone. 

 This, industry sources said, will lead to an immediate increase in tariff for user industries such as power plants and fertilizer units in Gujarat, which is the landfall for ONGC's offshore gas field as well as houses three gas import terminals. 

 Consumers further away from the source, say in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar, will benefit as they will now pay a lesser tariff. 

 ""The tariff for zone-1 of Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur pipeline (India's main truck line from Gujarat to Uttar Pradesh via Madhya Pradesh) will rise from Rs 20 per million British thermal unit to Rs 26 per mmBtu,"" a source said. 

 The increase will vary from pipeline to pipeline. 

 ""On average, the tariff for zone-1 customers will go up by 20-30 per cent,"" the source said. 

 The pipelines that will be part of the unified tariff plan include state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd-operated Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur (HVJ) and its supplementary Dahej-Vijaipur line and Dahej (in Gujarat) to Uran-Dabhol-Panvel (in Maharashtra) pipeline. 

 Also, the line from Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh to Haldia in West Bengal, Bokaro in Jharkhand and Dhamra in Odisha (called the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga) and Dadri (Uttar Pradesh) to Bawana-Nalga and Dabhol-Bangalore pipeline would be part of it. 

 Reliance Industries' subsidiary operated Shahdol-Phulpur line from its CBM block in Madhya Pradesh to Uttar Pradesh as also its formerly owned East-East pipeline from Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh to Baruch in Gujarat would also be part of the plan. 

 GSPL's proposed Mehsana in Gujarat to Bhatinda in Punjab and onwards to Jammu/Srinagar as well as Mallavaram-Bhopal-Bhilwara-Vijaipur lines would also be part of it. 

 Indian Oil Corp's (IOC) Dadri-Panipat pipeline is also part of the unified structure. 

 Sources said PNGRB will now notify unified tariffs for each of these pipelines. 

 The new tariff structure would help create a single gas market in the country by attracting investment to complete the gas grid and make it more easily accessible. This is part of the government's plan to raise the share of gas in India's energy mix to 15 per cent by 2030 from the current level of about 6.3 per cent to cut its carbon footprint."

IOC's chairman said this month that the refinery has been operating at 100% capacity since early November as local fuel demand has recovered.

 IOC has been gradually raising crude runs at its plants, which plunged to about 39% at the beginning of April when a nationwide coronavirus lockdown hit fuel demand.

 Along with its subsidiary Chennai Petroleum Corp, IOC controls about a third of the 5 million barrels per day (bpd) refining capacity in India, where fuel demand in October rose by 2.5%, its first year-on-year rise in eight months. 

 IOC is operating at full capacity despite lower global refining margins as its ""mandate"" is to meet the local fuel demand, Vaidya told an oil industry conference on Thursday.

 ""Refining margins are very poor, in fact they are just not sustainable ... but we are also investing heavily in petrochemicals as a strategy to de-risk the business of low margins,"" Vaidya said during the ADIPEC event. 

 Like other refiners, IOC normally operates its plants at more than installed capacity. Vaidya said the situation will return to normal in next quarter."

On November 5, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) issued an order granting more time to 41 city gas entities to complete their rollout commitment.

The time granted varies from 129 days to 251 days across different geographical areas depending on the duration of the COVID-19 lockdown, the order said.

The extra time is to make up for 69 days of the national lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the pandemic and additional restrictions imposed in states. A 60-day restoration period is given on top of the lockdown period.

PNGRB said it has given licences to retail CNG to automobiles and piped natural gas to household kitchens and industries in 230 geographical areas (GAs) across the country.

A geographical area is made up of one or more districts.

""However, in recent times, the entities have been facing a catastrophic situation due to the outbreak and the spread of COVID-19, a pandemic declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) that has affected every sector across the globe, including the city gas distribution (CGD) business,"" it said.

This resulted in CGD entities unable to perform their obligations.

The regulator listed the pandemic as a condition for force majeure that entitles entities for extra time.

IOC, GAIL India Ltd, Adani Gas, Gujarat Gas, Torrent Gas, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), Indraprastha Gas Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) are among the firms that got extra time.

PNGRB said it has ""approved the extension considering the national lockdown by Government of India (69 days), additional lockdown/restrictions imposed by state governments or by district authorities and a restoration period of 60 days"".

The board granted such extension to 41 CGD entities in respect of 185 GAs that have been considered eligible for force majeure extension on account of COVID-19.

""The decision of the board in this regard shall be final and binding on the entity,"" it added.

Earlier in September, PNGRB issued a fresh set of force majeure guidelines, listing events such as riots, natural disasters and restrictions by the government as conditions for allowing more time to complete city gas rollout obligations.

PNGRB gives out city gas licence to retail CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households on the basis of committed work programme like laying of gas pipelines and setting up CNG dispensing stations.

The guidelines came after a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19 from March 25 and state-level lockdowns since June hampered city gas projects.

Several city gas firms claimed force majeure after work on sites got stalled due to lockdown. Such claims, however, were not immediately accepted in absence of guidelines listing events that can trigger force majeure.

Force majeure refers to a clause that is included in contracts to remove liability for natural and unavoidable catastrophes that interrupt the expected course of events and prevent participants from fulfilling obligations."

Indian Oil Corp,"Nov 02, 2020, 07:50 PM IST",IOC says no plan for share buyback as of now,"New Delhi: State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), India's top oil company, has no plans to buyback shares as of now but will consider if there is a mandate, its Director (Finance) Sandeep Kumar Gupta said on Monday. Chasing a record Rs 2.1 lakh crore target from disinvestment proceeds, the government has asked over half a dozen cash-rich PSUs to repurchase shares to help shore up its finances amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

On a conference call with analysts and investors, Gupta said the company hasn't been asked by the government, its majority owner, to do a buyback. 

""We don't have any immediate plans for a share buyback,"" he said. 

Analysts said the government appetite for buyback in IOC is low because its holding in the company is at about 51.5 per cent. The government wants to retain at least 51 per cent stake in strategic PSUs such as IOC. 

The government is reportedly planning to ask Coal India Ltd, electricity generator NTPC Ltd, miner NMDC Ltd, MOIL Ltd, KIOCL Ltd, and Engineers India Ltd to buy back shares this year. The government, being the largest shareholder in these companies, will benefit from the transactions by tendering the equity it holds in return for cash. 

This will help the government access part of the more than Rs 40,000 crore of cash hoard with the companies as of March 31, at a time it has struggled to meet its target of raising money from tax and sale of state assets. So far the government has raised less than 3 per cent of the Rs 2.1 lakh crore disinvestment target. 

Gupta said the IOC board will consider share buyback if asked. 

He went on to add that the share buyback, if any, won't impact its capex plans for fiscal year to March 31, 2021. 

Despite a slow first quarter due to coronavirus lockdown, IOC is hoping to meet its about Rs 22,000 crore capital expenditure target for 2020-21. 

The government has been pushing state-owned companies to increase their capital expenditure as it looks to revive an economy seen contracting by up to 10 per cent in the current fiscal. 

Capital expenditure by PSUs is a critical driver of economic growth and needs to be scaled up for this year as well as next. 

Gupta said IOC is planning to expedite projects on drawing board to boost capex spend. 

However, only projects based on strong viability will be taken in future as the company assess demand destruction pandemic and the transition in energy sector it has forced. 

He said FY2022 capex won't be less than FY2021 target. 

IOC, the nation's biggest fuel retailers, plans to add 2,400 petrol pumps in FY2021, of which 994 stations have already been commissioned. 

""We want to add 2,000-2,500 retail outlets every year"" to maintain the leadership position, he said. 

Gupta said fuel demand is bouncing back fast on the back of festival season with petrol and diesel consumption back to pre-COVID levels already. 

This has seen refineries improve operating run rate, he said adding IOC refineries were running at 95 per cent of the capacity. 

Company's crude oil and petroleum product inventories are at optimal levels now, he said adding the company was holding 9 million tonnes of crude inventory and 8.4 million tonnes of petroleum product stocks."

The festive season-fuelled consumer demand has increased goods transportation across the country, driving up diesel sales, an industry executive said. With manufacturing and commercial activity rising, more vehicles are on the road, increasing demand for fuels.



Several online retailers have registered strong sales during the festive season that began mid-October and will extend until the beginning of the new year.

Strong sales of cars and two-wheelers too have contributed to robust fuel demand. India’s exports also rose 6% in September over the last year, driven by sharp growth in shipments of iron ore, garments and drugs.

People’s preference for personal vehicles to avoid crowded public transport during the pandemic has also boosted demand for petrol.

Recovery in fuel demand has improved runs at refineries. The average run at Indian Oil Corp, the nation’s largest refiner, has risen to 94% from below 50% in April."

Bharti Airtel,"Dec 14, 2020, 08:21 PM IST",Airtel believes ARPU will reach Rs 200 levels in few months: Report,"New Delhi: Bharti Airtel is of the view that average revenue per users (ARPUs) would have touched Rs 200 already had the pandemic not happened, and believes that the company should get there in the next few months, according to a latest Goldman Sachs report. In a recent note, Goldman Sachs said it had hosted Bharti Enterprises Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal at its CIO Tour on December 11, where he shared thoughts on various aspects of the telecom business, including his outlook on industry structure and tariffs, 5G, smartphones/devices, among others. 

 Talking on the key takeaways from the session, it said Bharti Airtel believes ARPUs would have reached Rs 200 already if COVID-19 had not happened, and believes the company should get there in the next few months. 

 It further said as per Bharti, the ideal ARPU for the industry is Rs 300, but that it could be a longer journey to get there. 

 ""ARPUs at Rs 300 does not mean there will not be offerings for consumers at Rs 100 price points, and the company believes high-end customers should be able to pay USD 6-8 per month,"" it said. 

 Bharti mentioned that it will not raise tariffs at the cost of market share, Goldman Sachs report stated. 

 According to the report, Bharti Airtel believes the current industry structure (4 players) is ideal, but expects market share to consolidate further. 

 ""..it believes the top two operators can end up with around 80 per cent market share (currently around 75 per cent) in 12-18 months,"" the note said. 

 Bharti does not expect a material market share difference between the top two players, it said adding that the company's focus is on higher quality customers, and it has consistently been able to attract and retain mid-to-high end users. 

 On 5G, the report said Bharti Airtel believes if spectrum prices were to remain at current levels ""they may not participate in auctions in 2021"". 

 ""However, by 2022, Bharti may need to buy 5G spectrum - the company expects 5G launch, at least in India's main cities, to start happening in 2-3 years. Per Bharti, there are currently not enough use cases for 5G and devices will need to be more widely available at lower price points for 5G to happen,"" it said. 

 The company does not think 5G will lead to incremental capex as it would just be substituted by a reduction in 4G capex, the report added. 

 Bharti Airtel's execution continues to be near-flawless, Goldman Sachs said adding that it has been encouraged by the closing of the incremental market share gap between Bharti and Jio. 

 ""While a tariff hike is inevitable in the near term in our view, given Vodafone Idea's stretched balancesheet, we see Bharti continuing to win market share in the interim; the company's current 32 per cent market share can potentially rise to mid-to-high 30 per cent in the foreseeable future if tariffs do not move up rapidly,"" the report said.

Bharti Airtel,"Dec 10, 2020, 07:29 AM IST",Policy initiatives must ensure 5G availability at affordable prices: DoT Official,"New Delhi: There is a need to bring in affordable pricing for the fifth-generation (5G) airwaves, besides making adequate airwaves available as part of the Centre's new policy initiatives, a senior Department of Telecommunications (DoT) official said Wednesday, views that echoed the industry’s long standing demands.

""The policy initiatives required from the government for 5G must include ensuring spectrum availability at affordable prices, lower reserve price, and uniform right-of-way (RoW) policy for fiberisation. Thus, there exists several new opportunities, and the future is bright and exciting,"" Bharat Kumar Jog, member-services at DoT, said in his address to the India Mobile Congress.

He added that the economic value of 5G is estimated to be $13.2 trillion worldwide, and India's share would come close to $1 trillion by 2035.

The views from one of the top government officials echoed the concerns of the industry, which has termed the telecom regulator’s base price for 5G spectrum in the 3300-3600 MZ band of Rs 492 crore per unit as too expensive. Operators have also said that the current 5G spectrum quantity on offer—a total of 175 MHz in the 5G band—was too low, and that the industry needs at least 100 MHz per carrier to ensure quality next generation services.

Jog’s comments come a day after top executives of Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea called on the government to address challenges such as high spectrum prices and levies, low bandwidth availability and hurdles in RoW clearances for a sector which has ensured robust digital connectivity during the Covid-19 pandemic. In fact, Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal has repeatedly said that India’s no. 2 telco would not be able to buy any 5G airwaves at the current reserve price.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), under previous chairman RS Sharma, had rejected the DoT’s request to reduce the base price. The regulator then had put the ball in the government's court, saying the telecom department could review it. The Digital Communications Commission (DCC), the highest decision-making body in the DoT, has since approved the prices, and any change can now be made only by the Union Cabinet. 

The government though hasn’t decided any timeline for the 4G and 5G auctions, though it is widely believed that it is aiming to hold the 4G sale in January-March 2021, and 5G later in the year. The auction proposal is yet to be presented to the Cabinet."
Bharti Airtel,"Dec 09, 2020, 07:35 PM IST","Airtel, Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea want “right amount” of 5G spectrum","NEW DELHI: Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio said that the authorities must ensure availability of “right amount” of spectrum for 5G services at the right time along with a robust infrastructure policy. Not doing so will derail India’s 5G prospects, they said.

“...spectrum tranche has to be the right size since it impacts the differential experience. In some places where operators have launched 5G with the smaller tranche of spectrum are not able to offer a differential experience,” Randeep Sekhon, chief technology officer at Bharti Airtel said.

Reliance Jio’s president and group CTO-mobility, Shayam Mardikar has also suggested that the right amount of spectrum for 5G is a must in India considering the population density.

“This kind of deployment of 5G [with a smaller tranche] will always keep us on our toes and we will never be able to reach locations where we are actually becoming the economic backbone to enable all the other industries,” he said. “We have too many people, too little spectrum and too much demand. It is very clear. This gap can be filled with 5G spectrum for retail customers.

Rajinder Singh, Vodafone Idea’s executive vice president of technology said that contiguous spectrum in the right amount and the right band is crucial for the country’s 5G ambitions.

 “This will be the key thing and the first success factor. “Secondly, the pricing of that spectrum is very important and all telcos, government and the regulator must see how some of the Asian countries like Japan and Hong Kong have charged very low fees for initial 5G availability.” Singh said that addressing these issues will potentially allow telcos to roll out the network and grow it further.

3300-3600 MHz (300 MHz) frequency band was envisaged for the 5G services. However, as per the recent spectrum allocation document, the government is allocating just 175 MHz (3425 -3600 MHz) for 5G after ISRO and the Department of Space (DoS) raised concern in allowing 3400-3425 MHz portion for 5G since they need this for NaVIC application.

Indian telecom operators said that the current availability of just 175 MHz for all service providers in the 3300-3600 mid band is ""grossly inadequate"" and would adversely impact the 5G rollout in the country.

Globally a 5G operator is generally assigned a contiguous block of 100 MHz of spectrum in the mid-band. Indian telcos want at least 80MHz per telco in the 3.5GHz band.

COAI, which represent all three telcos, recently urged the DoT to ensure at least 400 MHz per telco in mmwave bands (26, 28, 37 GHz) and at least 2x10MHz per operator in sub-GHz bands 600MHz and 700MHz.

Airtel’s Sekhon also said 5G is an ""expensive proposition"" for telecom operators to build up and therefore good use cases and affordable handsets are needed for mass adoption of 5G in India

""...operators need to work together along with government, regulators and OEMs (device makers) to make this a success in India, and a good start is very important,"" he added.

India has already delayed 5G spectrum auction to sometime next year due to spectrum availability, unavailability of use cases and lack of clarity on whether Huawei will be allowed to deploy 5G networks in India.

Airtel’s Sekhon said the business case for 5G is the biggest concern for telecom operators and the ecosystem. “India’s 4G speeds are lowest in the world. We need spectrum for wireless broadband connectivity. Initial spectrum for 5G will allow telcos to offer higher speeds.”

Sekhon also called for an aggressive fiberization drive for mobile towers in the country besides addressing power issues for 5G cell towers.

Jio’s Mardikar said that a robust infrastructure policy and enablement of capabilities like power and tower densification along with right of way approvals will become the foundation for 5G technology in India.

He also said that devices, services and vertical ecosystems can play a very important role on the 5G.

Vodafone Idea’s Singh said that 5G use cases are crucial and need to be co-created with the industries in the areas of automation and manufacturing.

“Initial revenue streams will come from the manufacturing segment for telcos. We should use this make in India opportunity and should work with telcos and the ecosystem to leverage the opportunity using 5G to become the manufacturing hub,” Singh said.

Providing medical services in rural areas can also be an opportunity for the government which can work with telcos using fiber assets along with 5G spectrum, Vodafone Idea’s Singh said. “5G based broadband is the service which will be available to the society at large.”

A robust 5G will enable services like cloud gaming and AR/VR immersive entertainment. Sekhon said that people will pay for 5G if content and service are available. “That content generation is where India can participate. Capability to build software, IP which can be exported to the world will be crucial,” he said.

Sekhon said that the pandemic has changed the digital behavior of Indians and has shown the possibilities for e-education and e-medicine.

He added that India has a chance to become a low-cost manufacturing hub for telecom equipment and mobile handsets.

Jio’s Mardikar said that the first phase of 5G service will tap the B2C segment where broadband enablement will take place. “Unlike any other country, our dependence on wireless broadband is paramount since we don’t have enough wired broadband penetration.”

He added that industry 4.0 and use cases for health, entertainment and education will drive the real 5G growth."

“There are some challenges too relating to tariffs, taxes, levies, spectrum availability and pricing,” Vodafone Idea (Vi) managing director Ravinder Takkar said at the India Mobile Congress on Tuesday. These concerns were broadly underlined by Bharti Airtel India and South Asia chief executive Gopal Vittal, Jio managing director Sanjay Mashruwala as well as Nunzio Mirtillo, Ericsson’s head of market area Southeast Asia, Oceania and India, in their respective speeches.

“There is talk of India is having its own 5G standards, this is an existential threat which could lock India out of the global ecosystem and slow down the pace of innovation,” Vittal said at the India Mobile Congress, further adding that such a move would lead India’s citizens down if it were to happen.

He compared the current situation to the CDMA versus the GSM debate in which he said the reason why GSM triumphed over the former, despite CDMA being technologically superior was because GSM was more widely adopted.

Earlier this year, the global mobile supplier association (GSA) had also reached out to the telecom department to express concerns over India’s telecom standards body, TSDSI’s local 5G standards, and said that it will lead to interoperability issues between devices and networks. Jio has backed the TSDSI in its recommendations.

GSA, in the letter to the telecom department, had said that adoption of regional standards pose serious challenges in the form of the higher cost of devices and services, and fragments the ecosystem, especially in cellular systems, a charge which was denied by TSDSI’s chairman, Bhaskar Ramamurthi.

Vittal also called upon the industry including telcos, device players, equipment manufacturers and IT companies to create an open India and collectively build the 5G ecosystem. “For this we have to come together. Set aside our differences and be part of One”, Vittal said, highlighting that the entire ecosystem would benefit from such a collaboration.

Lastly, Vittal asked for a stable and simple regulatory environment to enable fast growth of digital India. “We must have enabling policies that continue to keep access to technology affordable. Affordable to lay down fibre, which is the node of Digital India. Affordable spectrum that allows us to build networks that India deserves,” he said."

“I have no doubt given India's lead in the space industry and ISRO and the department of space’s call to the private sector, we should start to see advantages moving in India's favor in the space communication industry as well,” he added.

Bharti Airtel, he said, is contributing towards the digital ecosystem. “Every person in the Airtel and Bharti Ecosystem is doing its very best to ensure that the accelerate the digital dream of India. We serve a people in the most fruitful and meaningful way so that the absence of some of the physical infrastructure is mitigated by the digital ecosystem and infrastructure,” Mittal said.

Mittal said that the pandemic has accelerated the digital adoption of various products and services across the globe.

“Many of the things achieved many of the things that we are seeing today for several more years, but the force multiplier of this pandemic has been in some sense a boon for the digitalization of a country,” he said.

Airtel, he said, has stepped up efforts on the fixed line fiber, enterprise and government businesses. “Fiber roll out has been extensive. We are excited about the prospects of joining hands with Bharatnet to cover more India on fiber connectivity,” Mittal said."
Bharti Airtel,"Dec 07, 2020, 01:34 PM IST","Supreme Court imposes status quo in one-time spectrum charge case, next hearing in Feb","The Supreme Court on Monday imposed a status quo on fresh demand or recoveries between the government and Vodafone Idea in the one-time spectrum charge (OTSC) case. Appearing for the government, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta sought a status quo in the case with no fresh demands or payments by any side either, and asked for an early hearing, given its significance, a proposal which Harish Salve, appearing for Vodafone Idea, accepted. 

The Court said it will list the matter in February.

The OTSC dues are based on DoT rules that require a telco holding beyond 6.2 MHz/circle between July 2008 and December 31, 2012, to pay a one-time market-linked price for the excess spectrum held. Likewise, the telcos are required to pay the market price for airwave holdings beyond 4.4 MHz/circle between January 2013 till the expiry of their respective licences. 

Airtel two quarters ago had made provisions of Rs 7,004 crore in its exceptional item, mostly on account of OTSC dues. Vi had recognised Rs 3890 crore in its exceptional items in the March end quarter towards providing for OTSC dues. 

The tussle started with the government’s decision to charge telecom operators OTSC in the wake of the Supreme Court cancelling 122 telecom permits in 2012, under the alleged 2G scan which declared airwaves as public goods which were best utilised through an auction.

The cabinet had then decided to levy an OTSC on telcos that were allocated spectrum along with pan-India licences at Rs 1,658 crore. Under the subscriber linked criteria followed previously, telcos were given additional tranches of spectrum after they reached a certain subscriber base in a circle. 

However, the UPA II government then changed the policy and announced that all airwaves allocated beyond 4.4 Mhz will be charged for at a market rate.

But the telcos protested this move on retrospective dues. The matter went to Telecom Disputes Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) which ruled in July 2019 that the OTSC could be levied prospectively, not retrospectively.

TDSAT had observed that demand for such dues needed to come with the option of surrendering spectrum. So while the demand notice of 2012, came in with dues retrospect from 2008, the option of surrendering airwaves was given only from 2012 onwards and not from 2008.

The DoT then moved SC and the highest court refused to stay TDSAT order."
Bharti Airtel,"Dec 06, 2020, 04:55 PM IST","Airtel outpaces Jio on active users in September, Vodafone Idea loses more ground","KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel added as many as 3.8 million active mobile users in September, helped by the strongest mobile broadband customer additions among the Big 3 telcos, outpacing Reliance Jio’s 0.7 million additions, while Vodafone Idea (Vi) continued to cede further ground, stung primarily by lower network-related capex spends.

Loss-making Vi lost 3.4 million active customers, while Reliance Jio’s modest additions were sharply below the 4.6 million reported in August, Motilal Oswal said, analysing September subscriber data put out by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).

“Airtel captured the lion’s share of Vi’s subscriber losses, indicating that subscriber churn is taking place,” the brokerage said in a note to clients.

Brokerage ICICI Securities said Jio’s active subscriber market share was largely flat at 33.2% month-on-month with 318 million users, while Bharti Airtel fast catching up with a 33% share, up 35 basis points (bps) on month with 316 million subscribers (up from 313 million), while Vi’s dipped 40 bps to 27.2%, at 261 million (265 million).

As per Trai’s latest Visitor Location Register or `VLR’ data -- a key metric reflecting the actual number of subscribers actively using a mobile network, 78.76%, or 86 million, of Jio’s users were active compared with nearly 97% of Airtel’s and 88.4% for Vi’s. Despite Airtel’s strong active user additions, India’s overall active mobile user base grew by a modest 1 million to 958 million in September, dragged down by Vi’s losses and Jio’s slowdown on this score.

Trai data also showed that mobile number porting (MNP) requests jumped to 8.7 million in September, the highest since March 2018. “This could be a negative sign for Vi, as our checks show Airtel and Jio have been offering attractive offers in certain markets to port consumers to their networks,” said brokerage BNP Paribas.

ICICI Securities said the MNP churn rate had risen to 0.8% in September vs the 0.5%, pre-Covid level. “MNP churn remains high and we see Airtel poised to gain from it”.

Global ratings agency Fitch recently estimated that Vi could lose another 50-to-70 million customers in the next one year, having already lost around 155 million users in the past nine quarters.

Analysts say the steady fall in Vi’s active users base is primarily due to its weak network capabilities compared to its financially-stronger rivals, noting that its Rs 1,040 crore capex in the September quarter was way below Airtel's Rs 6,790 crore and Jio's Rs 5,426 crore.

Vi, though, is hoping to raise Rs 25,000 crore shortly via a mix of debt and equity to invest in its 4G network and also clear its balance Rs 50,400 crore of AGR arrears to the government."

Bharti Airtel could their margins improve going ahead as consumers continue to spend more and increasingly more people move to the 4G network, Moody’s outlook research report said.

“Bharti Airtel Ltd’s (Ba1 stable) margins are likely to improve to about 45 per cent in 2021 from 40 per cent for the 12 months through September 2020, on the back of rising average revenue per user (ARPU) and a higher proportion of 4G subscribers,” the research report said. Bharti Airtel will deliver on the back of improving profitability in the Indian mobile sector the report added.

The report said that globally telecom operators would see a healthy revenue growth. In India tariff hikes will drive an increase in ARPU, which together with a rising 4G subscriber base will support revenue growth, it added.

India has seen a three way war between Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone. While the country boasts to be the second largest telecom network globally, companies are struggling to maintain profitability. This also comes at a time when there is already a talk of India moving to fifth generation network.

Capital expenditure or Capex to revenue will decline marginally, driven by lower capital intensity in developed markets including India the report said. “Average capex/revenue in Asia Pacific region will fall to about 22 per cent in 2021 from 25 per cent in 2019, but continue to be higher than US and European telcos’ ratios of below 20 per cent. Emerging market telcos will spend around 30 per cent of revenue on capex in 2021 with investments primarily in infrastructure to enhancing existing networks and expand coverage and developed market telcos’ capex to revenue will fall to 14 per cent from 18 per cent in 2019, as they benefit from well-established networks; while most markets have launched 5G services, network rollout will be progressive, keeping capital intensity stable,” the Moody’s outlook report said."

Bharti Airtel,"Dec 03, 2020, 08:14 AM IST",Government may not seek additional AGR payments this fiscal,"Mumbai: The government is unlikely to proactively seek additional amounts from Vodafone Idea (Vi) and Bharti Airtel towards adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues this financial year and will approach the Supreme Court in April to decide on the dispute over upfront payments.

Officials in the Department of Telecommunications said the SC will clarify the timeline for payment of the first instalment and whether it should be equivalent to 10% of the total dues or the outstanding amount.



“They (Airtel and Vi) have written to us that they have paid their 10% dues, but we differ. The matter will now be decided by the Supreme Court,” one official said. “We are mandated by the order to inform the court by April 7 on defaults and payments made by telcos… we will do that and see what the court says.”

DoT has also sought Solicitor General Tushar Mehta’s opinion on the matter.

DoT hasn’t responded to letters from Airtel and Vi seeking clarity on the method used to calculate the AGR dues and stating that they have paid their dues, the official said, adding that there was no need to respond in the interim, since, according to them, the order was very clear.

The Supreme Court ruled on September 1 that telecom operators must pay 10% of their AGR dues as demanded by DoT by March 31, 2021, and the remainder in equal instalments every financial year up to March 31, 2031.

Vi and Airtel said they have paid more than 10% of their AGR dues and that their first instalment falls due only in the year ending March 2022.

However, DoT’s interpretation is that the court was aware of the payments already made by the operators and when it asked them to pay 10% of the AGR dues, it clearly meant they needed to pay that in addition to the amounts already paid. The rest would need to be spread equally over 10 years.

Airtel and Vi are convinced they have followed the court’s order and need to pay ₹25,976 crore and about ₹50,400 crore more, respectively, over 10 annual instalments.

The next round of the battle over AGR dues comes as internet service providers are expected to head to the apex court and ask for clarity on whether they have to pay the dues or can be excused like the public-sector units, an industry executive said, asking not to be identified.

The telecom tribunal dismissed a plea by internet service provider Netmagic Solutions to prevent DoT from seeking AGR dues, saying it will not interfere with the SC’s order. The tribunal order has implications for some 35 major ISPs, which face AGR due demands of about ₹18,000 crore."

“Almost $6.3 billion or around 39 per cent of the total $16 billion of debt maturing through 2022 pertains to speculative-grade issuers,” the report said.

Many companies that are issuing high yield bonds may continue to face significant financing risks even going ahead as Indian economy grapples with Covid pandemic induced problems. Several highly leveraged large companies and even some mid-scale ones had turned to bonds as they faced liquidity issues during the pandemic. Many companies were even using the funds raised through these high yield bonds for their working capital, industry trackers said.

The Moody’s research report said that market access will remain elusive for financially weaker entities amid elevated bond yields and that a sizeable debt maturities increase the probability for distressed exchanges by speculative-grade issuers. “Supportive funding environment and well spread out maturities underpin strong liquidity for investment-grade companies,” the report added.

A company is often forced to offer high yields to investors when they are unable to or find it hard to raise funds through other traditional sources. The Moody’s research has categorised about $670m bond due Jun 2021 by Vedanta and Bharti Airtel Intl’s EUR 750m bond due May 2021 as speculative. The research said that other “speculative-grade maturities” that are set to mature in 2022 includes JSW’s $500m bond due Apr 2022, Marble II $500m bond due Jun 2022 and Vedanta $1bn bond due Jul 2022."

“The merged tower-co (BHIN & Indus) is expected to announce a special dividend of about Rs 48 billion (Rs4,800 crore) within three months of its merger closure. At the new ownership of 41.66%, Airtel would get a proportionate pre-tax special dividend of Rs 20 billion (the additional 4.9% stake would lead to increased dividend of Rs 2.36 billion). This would largely help partially fund this transaction,” brokerage BofA Securities said in a note released after Airtel’s stake buy.

At 5.8 times the expected FY22 Ebitda (versus a historical range of 8-12X), Bharti Infratel is one of the cheapest tower companies, cheaper than even Indian operators, BoFA said.

The tower company’s prospects may see improvement with an expected uptake in 5G and any potential fibre-leasing model in the next two-three years, but on the other hand, potential rent cuts and further shrinking of coverage by Vodafone Idea may hurt fundamentals, the house said.

It also noted that the Infratel stock price had risen 23% in the last 12 trading sessions, compared with the Sensex’s 2% gain, thus making it a relatively costlier investment for Airtel.

The scheme is expected to support and incentivise exports from India, similar to the plan which has kicked off for the mobile handset industry. 

The European telecom gear vendors also want India to focus on bringing the component ecosystem under the new scheme, which aims at giving sops of nearly Rs 12,200 crore. 

“Cost levels in India productions are a little higher than other countries, so I really welcome this kind of a policy which is coming up to provide incentives for local manufacturers because that really helps the Indian economy,” Sanjay Malik, the India market head for Nokia told ET. “The whole policy framework is known at a very high level...

 “We expect Bharti and Jio to increase their combined revenue market share to 80% (it was around 74% by September) in the next 12-18 months,” Fitch Ratings said on Monday.

 In the second quarter, Airtel added 14 million subscribers — double that of Jio's seven million. 

Vodafone Idea is rapidly losing market share given its weak balance sheet and limited financial flexibility. Fitch said Vodafone Idea's plan to raise about $3.4 billion through a mix of equity and debt is unlikely to restore its competitive position and reverse subscriber losses, as it would still be insufficient capex.



Vodafone Idea has so far paid about $1.1 billion of its total $8.9 billion dues required to be paid to the telecom department as adjusted gross revenue (AGR).


Outlook on Airtel 
 Fitch Ratings on Monday also affirmed Airtel’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating at ‘BBB-’. The outlook on IDR is negative. 
It also affirmed Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) BV’s senior unsecured guaranteed bonds at ‘BBB-’ and Network i2i Limited’s subordinated perpetual bond at ‘BB’.

 Fitch, however, added that the negative outlook does not reflect its view of Bharti's underlying credit profile — which has been improving due to strong growth in the Indian and African wireless operations — but rather the heightened probability that India's country ceiling (BBB-) could be lowered to ‘BB+‘. 

“Such an action would constrain Bharti’s IDR and senior issue ratings to BB+.""

“""We forecast Bharti’s (FY21) funds from operations (FFO) net leverage to be 2.2x-2.4x, below the threshold of 2.5x above which we will take negative rating action, the agency said in a release. 
 “We expect Bharti's FY21 revenue and Ebitda to rise by around 17%-25%, on improvement in the Indian wireless market and continued strong growth in African markets,” Fitch said. 

It added that Airtel’s Indian wireless Ebitda is expected to rise 40-50% in FY21, led by 15 million subscriber additions and monthly average revenue per user (ARPU) improvement of 10%-12%.

 The agency also expects Airtel to generate small positive free cash flow in FY21 on flat core capex, lower interest costs and the two-year moratorium on the payment of existing spectrum dues, which will defer about $840 million in each of FY21 and FY22. 

“We expect FY21 as absolute core capex will most likely be flat at ₹210-220 billion (FY20: ₹221 billion), ignoring one-time payments for spectrum assets,” noted the ratings agency."
Bharti Airtel,"Dec 01, 2020, 08:00 AM IST",Vodafone Idea likely to lose up to 70 million subscribers over next year: Fitch,"New Delhi: Vodafone Idea (Vi) is expected to lose 50-70 million subscribers in the next 12 months after haemorrhaging 155 million subscribers in the last nine quarters, Fitch Ratings said, adding that Reliance Jio Infocomm could net more than half of Vi’s subscriber losses, with Bharti Airtel bagging the rest.

 “We expect Bharti and Jio to increase their combined revenue market share to 80% (it was around 74% by September) in the next 12-18 months,” Fitch Ratings said on Monday.

 In the second quarter, Airtel added 14 million subscribers — double that of Jio's seven million. 

Vodafone Idea is rapidly losing market share given its weak balance sheet and limited financial flexibility. Fitch said Vodafone Idea's plan to raise about $3.4 billion through a mix of equity and debt is unlikely to restore its competitive position and reverse subscriber losses, as it would still be insufficient capex.



Vodafone Idea has so far paid about $1.1 billion of its total $8.9 billion dues required to be paid to the telecom department as adjusted gross revenue (AGR).


Outlook on Airtel 
 Fitch Ratings on Monday also affirmed Airtel’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating at ‘BBB-’. The outlook on IDR is negative. 
It also affirmed Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) BV’s senior unsecured guaranteed bonds at ‘BBB-’ and Network i2i Limited’s subordinated perpetual bond at ‘BB’.

 Fitch, however, added that the negative outlook does not reflect its view of Bharti's underlying credit profile — which has been improving due to strong growth in the Indian and African wireless operations — but rather the heightened probability that India's country ceiling (BBB-) could be lowered to ‘BB+‘. 

“Such an action would constrain Bharti’s IDR and senior issue ratings to BB+.""

“""We forecast Bharti’s (FY21) funds from operations (FFO) net leverage to be 2.2x-2.4x, below the threshold of 2.5x above which we will take negative rating action, the agency said in a release. 
 “We expect Bharti's FY21 revenue and Ebitda to rise by around 17%-25%, on improvement in the Indian wireless market and continued strong growth in African markets,” Fitch said. 

It added that Airtel’s Indian wireless Ebitda is expected to rise 40-50% in FY21, led by 15 million subscriber additions and monthly average revenue per user (ARPU) improvement of 10%-12%.

 The agency also expects Airtel to generate small positive free cash flow in FY21 on flat core capex, lower interest costs and the two-year moratorium on the payment of existing spectrum dues, which will defer about $840 million in each of FY21 and FY22.

The deployment of 5G-ready network started in June and will cover hundreds of sites, the statement said. 

 It will include upgrading existing 2G, 3G and 4G radio access network (RAN) coverage in urban, semi-urban, highways, tourist spots and central business districts in Nairobi and the rest of Kenya, it added. 

 Nokia's network infrastructure will also offer Airtel Kenya the option to smoothly transition to 5G when necessary. The upgraded network will deliver enhanced connectivity to customers of Airtel Kenya and access to new, high-speed data services. 

 Airtel Kenya CEO P D Sarma said in the statement said, ""We are in the midst of rolling out our network to enhance coverage along with modernisation of our data network that will help us deliver improved, high-speed data services to our customers."" 

 He added that this will allow customers seamless coverage enhancing their browsing experience further. ""We are excited to partner with Nokia on this project. Its technology portfolio improves our network quality considerably and also allows us to move to 5G services in the future."" 

 Under the contract, Nokia is supplying Airtel Kenya telecom gears for both indoor and outdoor coverage, including base stations and radio access products. 

 The improved network will provide higher data speeds using additional 4G spectrum bands and provide access to secure, high-speed and reliable data services, the statement said. 

 Nokia Head of CEWA Market Unit Rajiv Aggarwal said, ""This is an exciting deal in an exciting market. We are proud to supply Airtel Kenya with our comprehensive AirScale portfolio and support the operator with its efforts to deliver the best possible connectivity experiences to end users in Kenya.""

Bharti Airtel,"Nov 26, 2020, 08:33 PM IST",Airtel CEO Vittal calls on Govt to keep 5G spectrum prices affordable,"KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel chief executive Gopal Vittal has called on the government to keep spectrum prices affordable to give telcos the financial headroom to invest meaningfully in 5G networks.

He also underlined the need for strong collaboration between the government, private sector and academia to leverage the power of the next-gen fast broadband technology and building a vibrant 5G ecosystem, spanning devices, networks, apps and services.

“One of the critical enablers for Digital India is affordable spectrum so that we can invest in building networks rather than spending money on just airwaves,"" Vittal said at a Ficci event Thursday.

His comments come at a time when the government plans to hold a 4G airwaves sale in early-2021, which may be followed by a sale of 5G airwaves later next year. Vittal, in fact, had recently said the Sunil Mittal-led telco would give 5G airwaves a miss if auctioned at the reserve prices set by the sector regulator, that it feels are unaffordable.

Fifth-generation wireless broadband technology, he said, is all about building the ecosystem, and for that to happen there is a need for very strong collaboration between academia, government and the private sector that not only includes telecom, but digital players, manufacturing players, banks and IT companies.

“As we get to a 5G world, the real leverage of this technology would come from the capacity to build an ecosystem across devices, networks, applications and services, and that is really what this is all about,” Vittal said.

Calling the telecom industry the country’s connectivity backbone, he stressed the importance of a combination of infrastructure, affordable spectrum and stable, long-term policies, terming them critical enablers for Digital India.

The Airtel CEO also underscored the criticality of fast-track right of way (RoW) clearances to speed up fiberisation of tower networks as India braces for 5G.

In a related development, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) secretary Sunil Kumar Gupta built a strong case for collaborative efforts and initiating field trials for developing India-relevant use cases in order to deploy 5G technology meaningfully in India. ""There is a need to encourage trials for use cases that are good for India for 5G to succeed,” the top Trai official said.

Ahead of the next spectrum sale, the Big 3 telcos, Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea (Vi) are known to be working on the development of locally-relevant 5G use cases are technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR), and Internet of Things (IoT)."

This would require strong collaboration between the government, private sector players and academia, he added.

Noting that the telecom sector is the connectivity backbone for the country and its businesses, Vittal stressed on the importance of infrastructure, affordable spectrum and stable, long-term policies, terming them critical enablers for Digital India.

""As technology evolves and as we get to a 5G world, I believe there is a need for very strong collaboration between academia, government, private sector...that not only includes telecom...it includes digital players, manufacturing players, banks, IT companies, to see how this ecosystem can be built, because 5G as you know is about the ecosystem,"" said Vittal, Bharti Airtel's MD and chief executive for India and South Asia.

Speaking at the 'Global R&D Summit 2020' organised by FICCI, Vittal said the real leverage of 5G will come from fully-built, complete ecosystem spanning devices, networks, applications and services.

""So while the technology is going to get more efficient, the spectral efficiency of this technology will be far superior to anything that we have seen in the past.

""I think the real leverage of this technology will come from the capacity to build an ecosystem across devices, networks, applications and services... and that is really what this is all about,"" he said.

Vittal noted that telecom and its transformative impact offered a ""massive opportunity"" for substantial productivity gains.

He further said the sector plays a critical role in all aspects, right from ensuring seamless functioning of payment systems to work-from-home, and from ensuring remote access to quality healthcare to enabling online education for children.

The industry is ""uniquely positioned"" to deliver major productivity benefits for the economy and businesses through digital technology, science and partnerships, he emphasised.

""One of the most critical enablers for Digital India is improved access to infrastructure, affordable and easy access to Right of Way, so we can lay out fibre when needed, affordable spectrum...so we can invest in building networks rather than spend money on just airwaves, and finally stable and long term policies to encourage more investments with lesser risks,"" Vittal said."
Bharti Airtel,"Nov 26, 2020, 01:34 PM IST","Following the likes of Buffett, Peter Lynch biggest mistake of my life: Shankar Sharma","NEW DELHI: When most investors swear by the investing principles of fabled names like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch, Shankar Sharma says following these legends has been the biggest mistake of his life.

“If I have to be granted a wish, I want another 25 years. Because I do not want to repeat the mistakes of the past 25 years in investing. The biggest of those mistakes was following the investing greats like Buffett, Philip Fisher or Peter Lynch. Because what they gave us had no method,” Sharma said at a conference on Tuesday.

He said what these investing greats gave the investor fraternity was a personalised approach to investing, which is not a scalable way of looking at businesses or companies, because they exist in different geographies or markets.

The investing style followed by Buffett, which is based on buying excellent businesses at fair prices, has been criticised in an era when most growth companies, especially those from the technology sector, are available at expensive prices. This left his followers behind when tech stocks saw the rally of their lifetime.

Buffett’s strategy has also trailed S&P500 in terms of returns in recent years, giving more ammunition to his critics. For example, shares of Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company for all of his investments, are up 46 per cent from their March lows while the S&P500 has added 62 per cent since then.

“My learning today is that you do not need to do it that way (i.e. follow investing greats). Actually, it is the exact opposite (that you need to do). You need to have breadth analyses than depth of analysis. This requires you to understand many things rather than understand few things very well,” said the Founder of First Global.

He said if an investor is able to broaden his understanding, then it can increase his ability to look at many factors, and therefore, you do not need to buy only one stock or put all your eggs in a couple of baskets. That is the single biggest mistake we all make, he said.

Shankar Sharma-led First Global’s flagship fund, The India Super 50 PMS Portfolio, has delivered 19.50 per cent returns since inception and 21 per cent in last six months against 3.8 per cent negative and 19.6 per cent positive returns for NSE500 index for the comparable periods, data available with PMS AIF World showed.

The strategy is invested in 52 stocks and its top holdings include RIL, Tube Investments, Bharti Airtel, Alkyl Amines Chemicals and AstraZeneca Pharma.

Another Shankar Sharma strategy, Indian Multi-Asset Allocation PMS, has however underperformed NSE500 over the past six months, rising just 9.1 per cent against a 13.20 per cent gain for the latter. This strategy is heavily tilted towards gilt and gold, and not equity.

“You can actually make a billion dollars by buying 25 stocks. In fact, you can make even more by buying 100 stocks,” Sharma said. He has been advocating diversification of investments for a while now, as he believes this reduces the risk factor involved in buying a single stock.


Tips for new investors
Sharma shared a few tips for new and young investors who have entered the market this year during the peak Covid crisis, which include learning to manage risks and avoid investing in just one stock.

“Today, you will see even the experienced fund managers putting 10-20 per cent of the fund in a single stock. This is recipe for disaster. Merely because it worked doesn’t mean it was right,” he said.

The seasoned investor said new investors should be humble, and not be high on the recent success in the market. “Humility will teach you risk management. And, losses will come out of lack of risk management,” he said.

His second piece of advice was to learn all forms of investing and trading, and not just focus on what the investing greats have professed.

“The more the skills you add, the better would be the strike rate. If you understand trading, you will become a better investor at some point. Because, you will be able to judge the pulse of the market in a far better way than a fund manager who has not understood all this,” he said."
Bharti Airtel,"Nov 25, 2020, 06:46 PM IST",Airtel narrows incremental RMS gap with Jio: Analysts,"KOLKATA: Bharti Airtel has sharply narrowed the gap with Reliance Jio on incremental revenue market share (RMS) in the September quarter, underlining the Sunil Mittal-led telco's absorption of tariff hikes taken last December and stronger 4G customer additions.

The gap between Airtel and Jio on incremental RMS has more than halved in the September quarter, said sector experts, analysing latest telco financial numbers put out by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).

ICICI Securities, analysing Trai data, said the gap between Airtel and Jio’s incremental RMS has reduced to 14.8 percentage points in the September quarter from nearly 32 percentage points in the April-June period.

“Bharti’s incremental AGR market share was at 36% (in the September quarter) and its gap vs Jio is narrowing,” said ICICI Securities.

This is reflected in the much sharper sequential fall in Jio’s incremental RMS to 50.8% in the September quarter from 73.4% in the April-June period. Airtel’s, by comparison, has dipped merely from 41.5% in the June quarter to 36% in the July-September period.

A key performance metric, the incremental RMS of a company is the portion of increase in industry revenue that accrues to a telco. If incremental revenue market share is higher than a telco's current RMS, then its revenue share will go up with time, say industry experts. 

While Airtel’s incremental RMS at 36% is lower than Jio’s 50.8%, its stronger operational performance, particularly on the 4G customer adds front along with its higher ARPU, sets it on course to further narrow the gap in coming quarters, say analysts. The Sunil Mittal-led telco added over 14 million 4G customers, nearly double that of Jio’s net 7.3 million user adds in the fiscal second quarter.

J M Financial said overall telecom industry AGR (including revenue from NLD and ILD services) rose 4% sequentially to Rs 43,100 crore in the July-September period, rising for the fourth consecutive quarter, “driven by a mix of strong mobile broadband additions witnessed across telcos and tariff hikes taken last December”.

The brokerage said the sequential growth in sectoral AGR in absence of tariff hikes could have been led by 2G users upgrading to broadband due to the Covid-19 led surge in data usage. It, though, reckons the revenue growth momentum could moderate unless there is a significant and sustainable tariff hike going forward. 

Vodafone Idea (Vi) is reportedly considering a 15-20% tariff hike by the end of the year or in early-2021 as the loss-making telco looks to almost double its modest ARPU levels as it walks a tightrope between making a financial recovery and reining in customer losses. Airtel is likely to follow if that happen, though both incumbents are likely to closely watch Jio’s moves and calibrate their potential hikes accordingly. 

BNP Paribas expects Vi to take the lead on tariff hikes and feels Airtel is ready to follow. “Tariff hikes are a matter of time, though the timing and quantum remain uncertain,” the brokerage said."
Bharti Airtel,"Nov 25, 2020, 08:58 AM IST",Trai slaps ₹35 crore penalty on telcos for fake text messages,"Mumbai | New Delhi: The telecom regulator has imposed penalties collectively amounting to Rs 35 crore on eight operators including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea (Vi) and Reliance Jio for allowing cybercriminals to issue fake SMSes to dupe digital payment users.

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s penalties are on various counts of violation of the Telecom Commercial Communication Customer Preference Regulation, documents accessed by ET showed.

The other companies penalised are Videocon, Tata Teleservices, Quadrant Teleservices and state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd.

The highest penalty of Rs 30.1 crore was imposed on BSNL, which failed to respond to Trai’s show-cause notices and produce performance-monitoring reports, followed by Rs 1.82 crore on Vi, Rs 1.41 crore on Quadrant and Rs 1.33 crore on Airtel.

The move may be a boost for digital payment companies spearheaded by Paytm, which are embroiled in a tussle with the telecom industry in an ongoing case in the Delhi High Court.

At a hearing in September, the court had asked Trai to act against service providers violating regulations to curb spam calls and text messages, as reported by ET.

Paytm had contended that telecom operators had been lax in monitoring the issuance of SMS headers to telemarketers, which allowed fraudsters to manipulate their customers. SMS headers are unique IDs through which commercial text messages are sent.

Noida-based Paytm’s stance was mirrored by peers such as PhonePe and MobiKwik in an intervention plea filed in September.

The regulator, in separate orders to the companies, said that BSNL, Vi, Jio and Airtel even misreported the count of unsolicited calls and messages on their networks. Trai noted that as of November 23, about 223,000 headers of various principal entities were registered on a new system aimed at improving oversight.

“The telecom companies will definitely dispute this fine in the court, but I don’t expect any positive outcome because the regulator has done its independent investigation, so Paytm seems to have an upper hand clearly,” said a high court lawyer following the case.

All business entities that send promotional and transactional SMSes must register their headers and content on a blockchain-based platform operated by telcos. This will prevent spam SMSes, including fraudulent ones, being delivered without user consent and registration.

However, Trai’s case-by-case investigations showed that telcos had not been diligent in monitoring the type of communication being sent and thus violated the regulator’s code of practice.

Typically, fake headers and messages are disguised as coming from banks or payment executives to secure private details from unsuspecting customers to gain access to their bank accounts and siphon funds. Such frauds have proliferated during the lockdown months in tandem with the growing number of first-time digital payment users."

""Given the limited overlap in the operations of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, synergies from the merger are likely to be limited to savings on administrative overheads,"" Jeffries said in a report.

CLSA said only 4 out of 22 circles pan-India overlap in operations, but, even a 10% or so reduction in employee and other costs could lead to about 3% higher earnings.

The brokerage also estimates an extraordinary dividend of Rs 4,800 crore, about 8% of the yield in next three months.

The two year long merger deal between the two tower companies concluded last week, with UK's Vodafone group and Bharti Airtel now holding 28.1% and 36.7% stakes in the new company respectively. Vodafone Idea cashed in Rs 3760 crore by selling its 11.15% stake in Indus Towers.

CLSA expects likely stake sales by telcos in the the tower company, coinciding with improving growth outlook, which could rerate the stock.

""With Bharti Airtel’s higher 37% ownership versus Vodafone’s 28% (Vodafone also owns 44% of Vodafone Idea) which is pledged, changes in towerco shareholding are likely,"" CLSA said.

""With a potential fall in telco ownership, the towerco EV/Ebitda multiple could rerate, as it also coincides with an improving growth outlook. Mobile operators are getting stronger while tariff hikes and active infra/5G are new opportunities,"" it said.

The merged towerco as of 1HFY21 had 172,000 towers with tenancy of 1.83x, annualised revenue of Rs 25,400 crore, and Ebitda (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization) of Rs 12,500 crore, CLSA said."

GAIL,"Nov 26, 2020, 08:17 PM IST",Oil regulator PNGRB simplifies gas pipeline tariff,"New Delhi: Oil regulator PNGRB has simplified the country's gas pipeline tariff structure to make the fuel more affordable for distant users and to attract investment for building gas infrastructure. The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has notified regulations for a 'unified' tariff structure for over a dozen pipelines that form the National Gas Grid which will lead to a 20-30 per cent rise in transportation charges paid by users near the source but a reduction for consumers in the hinterland. 

 ""Unified tariff shall be determined by the Board in respect of the national gas grid system for each financial year before the start of such financial year,"" it said. 

 Currently, the tariff is levied in proportion to the distance transported - the longer the distance, the higher is the charge. This resulted in consumers away from the coast paying higher charges as compared to those near it. 

 PNGRB has now notified a two-zone tariff structure - Zone-1 will be 300-km from the source of gas (gas field or LNG import terminal) and Zone-II will be beyond that. 

 PNGRB said the tariff for the first tariff zone will be 40 per cent of the tariff for the second zone. 

 This, industry sources said, will lead to an immediate increase in tariff for user industries such as power plants and fertilizer units in Gujarat, which is the landfall for ONGC's offshore gas field as well as houses three gas import terminals. 

 Consumers further away from the source, say in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar, will benefit as they will now pay a lesser tariff. 

 ""The tariff for zone-1 of Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur pipeline (India's main truck line from Gujarat to Uttar Pradesh via Madhya Pradesh) will rise from Rs 20 per million British thermal unit to Rs 26 per mmBtu,"" a source said. 

 The increase will vary from pipeline to pipeline. 

 ""On average, the tariff for zone-1 customers will go up by 20-30 per cent,"" the source said. 

 The pipelines that will be part of the unified tariff plan include state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd-operated Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur (HVJ) and its supplementary Dahej-Vijaipur line and Dahej (in Gujarat) to Uran-Dabhol-Panvel (in Maharashtra) pipeline. 

 Also, the line from Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh to Haldia in West Bengal, Bokaro in Jharkhand and Dhamra in Odisha (called the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga) and Dadri (Uttar Pradesh) to Bawana-Nalga and Dabhol-Bangalore pipeline would be part of it. 

 Reliance Industries' subsidiary operated Shahdol-Phulpur line from its CBM block in Madhya Pradesh to Uttar Pradesh as also its formerly owned East-East pipeline from Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh to Baruch in Gujarat would also be part of the plan. 

 GSPL's proposed Mehsana in Gujarat to Bhatinda in Punjab and onwards to Jammu/Srinagar as well as Mallavaram-Bhopal-Bhilwara-Vijaipur lines would also be part of it. 

 Indian Oil Corp's (IOC) Dadri-Panipat pipeline is also part of the unified structure. 

 Sources said PNGRB will now notify unified tariffs for each of these pipelines. 

 The new tariff structure would help create a single gas market in the country by attracting investment to complete the gas grid and make it more easily accessible. This is part of the government's plan to raise the share of gas in India's energy mix to 15 per cent by 2030 from the current level of about 6.3 per cent to cut its carbon footprint."
GAIL,"Nov 16, 2020, 06:33 PM IST","Finally, Gail completes Kochi-Mangalore pipeline","KOCHI: The much-delayed Kochi-Mangalore natural gas pipeline project is finally ready for commissioning any day from now as the national energy major Gail India has completed the final 540-metre treacherous stretch across the Chandragiri river in northern Kerala, according to a senior company official.

The 444-km long natural gas pipeline was launched in 2009 at an estimated cost of Rs 2,915 crore and was to be commissioned in 2014. But opposition on safety and commercial grounds wherein the land price was the main hurdle, both from political parties and the public, ensured that the project lingered on. This led to the project cost nearly doubling to over Rs 5,750 crore.

""We have completed the most difficult stretch across the Chandragiri river in Kasargod district in northern Kerala, on Saturday. Now the testing is on and this will be completed in the next two days. Within this week itself gas will reach Mangalore through the 444-km pipeline,"" P Murugesan, the executive director and head of Southern region, Gail, told PTI over phone from Bengaluru on Monday.

A formal commissioning will be done later, according to the availability of the minister, he added.

The pipeline is charged up to Kannur now, and is live up to Kuttanand in Palakkad district, 90 km north of Kochi since June 2019 and of the remaining 354 km the line is ready up to Kannur. Kuttanad is the main junction of the project as from here the line bifurcates to Managalore and Bengaluru.

The first phase of the project was commissioned in August 2013 in the Kochi metropolitan area with industrial supplies and domestic supplies from February 2016 by Adani Gas.

Today the pipeline supplies 3.8 million cubic metres of gas every day to industrial and residential customers in Kochi and is set to cross 4 million cubic metres soon in the city itself, while Mangalore has a potential of 2.5 million cubic metres per day, Murugesan said.

With the commissioning the pipeline, gas demand in the state will touch 80-90 million cubic metres per annum from 60 million cubic metres now.

The pipeline is a big boost to the struggling Kochi LNT Terminal of Petronet which has a capacity of 5 million tonne annually but 90 per cent capacity has been idling due to the delay in completing the Kochi-Mangalore pipeline and Murugesan said with the commissioning the capacity utilisation of the LNG terminal will go up to 25-30 per cent.

Apart from huge environmental gains, the state can also gain monetarily as it can get up to Rs 1,000 crore by way of taxes alone. Supplying to the Kochi region alone helps the state earn over Rs 340 crore annually in tax revenue. 

The authorities were ready to complete the project this August but a 540-metre stretch across the Chandragiri river became a nightmare for them. So as a way out they reduced the diameter of the pipe to a fourth -- from 24 inches to just 6 inches now.

But Murugesan said this is a temporary arrangement and the work to lay 24 inch pipe will resume soon after commissioning of the project and once ready the switch-over will not disrupt gas supply.

He also said the pipeline will supply has to all the seven districts it passes through in the state -- Ernakulam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasargod -- as well as the hilly Wayanad district. Of these already city gas distribution is on in Kochi where its supplies 3.8 million cubic metres of gas every day.

The company was working on the 540-metre river stretch since late April but got inordinately delayed as this stretch goes up to 8 metres deep in the river bed at some places and has an elevation difference of 148 metres, as the river flows down a deep valley, making it one of the rarest engineering projects for the entire pipeline network across the country.

The project crosses as many as 96 water-bodies south of the Chandragiri river.

The problem with this stretch is that the river flows down through a valley to the Arabian Sea, forcing them to drill horizontally from under the river bed. The EPC contractor for this stretch was awarded to NR Patel & Company."

""In March, there was a record outflow from FPIs and record buying by domestic institutional investors. If I have to choose a time to invest, I would always choose March over November. If my investors are booking profit, so be it. At lower levels, I will be a buyer rather than a seller. Having said that, November, like October and September, saw profit booking by our clients.

""The auto industry was expecting a large decline in consumer interest in terms of bookings and inquiries. Although there has been a decline, it is marginal and certainly not as much as the expectations or the fear that was in the industry,"" Maruti Suzuki India Executive Director (Marketing and Sales) Shashank Srivastava told reporters in an interaction on Wednesday. 

 He added that in that sense it is a much more positive scenario post-festival than was earlier anticipated. Going by the current trends of booking and inquiries and low stock levels at the dealers and manufacturers, December should be fine, Srivastava said. 

 According to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations, passenger vehicle retail sales in November witnessed a year-on-year rise of 4.17 per cent to 2,91,001 units as Diwali-Dhanteras period led to rise in vehicle registrations, compared with 2,79,365 units in November 2019. 

 When asked about the road ahead, Srivastava said, ""There has been an element of pent-up demand so far. We really don't know when will it drain out."" 

 Therefore, he added, the fresh demand, long and steady demand in the auto industry depends completely on the fundamentals of the economy. ""There is a very high correlation between auto demand and per-capita growth."" 

 He said it will also depend on the sentiment surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 ""On those two factors, there is still some sort of uncertainty although we are hearing positive noises on both fronts as well,"" he said. Those were the main reasons ""why manufacturers are little apprehensive about giving forward guidance for the next quarter and beyond"", Srivastava added."

In March 2018, in continuation of their partnership discussions that kicked off in 2017, Suzuki agreed to supply premium hatchback Baleno and compact SUV Vitara Brezza to Toyota, while Toyota in return decided to supply its Corolla sedan to Suzuki. 

Later, the two companies agreed to expand the scope of their collaboration and discuss new joint projects in the fields of technological development, vehicle production, and market development. 

Under the agreement, TKM would manufacture models developed by Suzuki for sale in India through their respective brand networks.

 ""The more the industry can sell, the more jobs will be created in the economy,"" he noted. 

 Bhargava pointed out that creating jobs across sectors was important for the overall growth of the economy. 

 He, however, criticised states which have reserved jobs in manufacturing for locals. 

 ""It is an anti-competitive step,"" Bhargava said. 

 He also said MSMEs have to be as globally competitive as the large companies because the entire supply chain determines the overall competitiveness. 

 Bhargava also noted that the industry cannot be competitive unless the promoters and managers treated workers as partners. 

 He pointed out that MSI owed its success to explaining to its workers that they will prosper if the company grew and backing that with policies and actions that delivered income and career growth to employees."

Nifty opened positive on Monday and traded in a broad range between 12,850 and 12,950 levels for most part of the session. The index fell in the initial half, but recovered well in the second half of the session to hit a new lifetime high of 12,968 level.

The index formed a small-bodied candle on the daily scale, as there was buying at lower levels, and closed positive with a gain of 67 points. Nifty has got stuck between 12,730 and 12,950 level since the last six sessions. Now, it has to hold above the 12,750-12,800 zone to witness a bounce towards 13,050 and 13,200 levels, while a hold below the same level may trigger weakness towards 12,700 and then 12,650 levels.

India VIX rose 6 per cent from 19.62 to 20.79 levels. Volatility has cooled down further and needs to hold at lower levels to ride the momentum with a higher market base.

The index formed a Bearish Candle on the daily scale and relatively underperformed the benchmark index. It has been consolidating between 28,500 and 29,800 levels since last five sessions and requires followup action to commence the next leg of rally.

Maruti Suzuki,"Nov 08, 2020, 10:53 AM IST",Automakers log dip in fleet sales in September quarter amid coronavirus pandemic,"New Delhi: Leading passenger vehicle manufacturers Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai Motor and Toyota Kirloskar Motor have witnessed sharp drop in fleet sales in the July-September period amid the coronavirus pandemic. The fleet segment sales have fallen during the period under review as people were opting for personal mobility options at the cost of shared and public transport in order to maintain distance in the times of the pandemic. 

 ""There has been extreme aversion on the part of customers against shared mobility and public transport and they are obviously looking at personal transport. If we look at the figures in our portfolio, fleet sales which include shared mobility, in the second quarter there was a drop of 69 per cent,"" Maruti Suzuki India Executive Director (Sales and Marketing) Shashank Srivastava said. 

 Taking into consideration the April-September period, the drop in fleet sales is 77 per cent as compared with last year, he added. 

 ""As a result in our portfolio, fleet sales which stood at 7 per cent last year (contribution to total sales) have fallen to 2.4 per cent this year,"" Srivastava said. 

 The auto major offers Tour range of variants across hatchback, sedan, van and MPV segments for commercial use in models like Alto, WagonR, Celerio, Eeco, TourS and Ertiga. 

 Hyundai Motor India, which sells its compact sedan Xcent in the fleet segment, has also seen sales dwindle in the segment post COVID-19. 

 ""The demand has shifted from shared mobility to personal segment so obviously the fleet segment has been impacted. Many financiers are also finding it tough, they are not sure about the future business of this segment so they are also becoming strict so the market for the fleet segment has come down,"" Hyundai Motor India Director (Sales, Marketing and Service) Tarun Garg said. 

 There is no impact on the overall sales as the personal segment has more than made for the loss, he added. 

 ""We continue to monitor the situation. It may be a short-term phenomena, the shared mobility segment has done so well in the global markets. It may start doing better here as well in future once the pandemic is over,"" Garg noted. 

 The company, however, did not share absolute numbers. 

 Similarly, Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) said it has also seen institutional sales of Innova Crysta drop during the second quarter. 

 ""The fleet segment is very badly hit. It has literally come to a standstill. People are just not willing to sit in taxis and shared cars. It is a very challenging scenario. There is a dip of 15-20 per cent in the taxi segment alone as compared with the year-ago period,"" TKM Senior Vice President (Sales and Service) Naveen Soni said. 

 The institutional sales of Innova Crysta, which include taxi, corporate and government sales altogether, have gone down by 65.72 per cent to 1,386 units in the July-September quarter this year as compared with 4,044 units in the year-ago period, the company said.

Maruti Suzuki,"Nov 05, 2020, 04:00 PM IST",Suzuki Motor Corporation gearing up to commence production at 3rd plant in Gujarat from April,"New Delhi: Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC) is preparing to commence vehicle production from its third unit in Gujarat from April next year, even as it on Thursday projected a 14 per cent decline in consolidated net sales for the ongoing fiscal based on its performance in India amid the coronavirus pandemic. 

 In a regulatory filing, Maruti Suzuki India said Suzuki Motor Gujarat Pvt Ltd (SMG), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SMC, has completed construction of its plant number three at Hansalpur, Gujarat. 

 SMG currently has two units at Hansalpur at Gujarat with a total capacity of 5 lakh units per annum. It exclusively supplies vehicles to Maruti Suzuki India. 

 ""SMG is now starting preparations to commence vehicle manufacturing (plant No 3) from April 2021 onwards. Production volume from the plant will depend upon business conditions and market demand,"" the filing said. 

 Last month, SMG had achieved a cumulative 10 lakh production milestone, becoming the fastest production site of Suzuki to achieve the record in 3 years and 9 months since starting production in February 2017. 

 In another development, SMC has projected a 14 per cent decline in its consolidated net sales at 3,000 billion yen. 

 SMC said previously, the forecasts for consolidated operating results for the ongoing fiscal ""were undetermined since we were unable to rationally calculate the forecasts owing to the spread of the new coronavirus pandemic in the company's major market of India"". 

 However, it said based on the latest situation and the trends in the company's operating results, it has been able to give a forecast. 

 With respect to the outlook for the ongoing fiscal, ""automobile sales in India, considering the pandemic situation, we have calculated as 80 per cent year-on-year, taking into concern certain amount of its risk."" 

 SMC said for the July-September period, the company ""gradually restarted production and sales activities according with the lift of lockdown orders in Japan and India, which are the important markets for our group"". 

 ""However, it is uncertain when the new coronavirus infection will end in India. In addition, a second wave of the new coronavirus is concerned in Japan and mainly northern hemisphere countries where winter approaches. Therefore, the severe situation that the company needs to pay attention to is expected to continue,"" it said. 

 In the first six months of the fiscal, SMC's consolidated net sales decreased by 27.6 per cent to 1,270.2 billion yen, and operating income decreased by 36.8 per cent to 74.9 billion yen year-on-year. 

 ""The decreased net sales and income for April-June could not be covered with recovery of sales in India and Japan, and efforts to decrease expenses for July-September,"" the company said. 

 It further said that first in the six months April-September 2020 period, ""15,417 million yen equivalent to fixed expenses related to production suspension due to lockdown in countries including India and Hungary to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus pandemic was recorded as extraordinary loss""."

Five of these stocks have consensus ‘buy’, two have 'hold' while one an ‘underperform’ ratings now.


These list includes:


IndusInd Bank: Outperform
Up 174 per cent since March 24, this banking stock has 18 'buy' calls, 12 'outperform', 10 ‘hold’, three 'underperform' and two 'sell' ratings, as per publicly available Reuters' Eikon database. Analysts said the recent capital raising has strengthened the balance sheet and the bank may gradually see improvement in profitability as credit costs normalise. Nomura India expects a credit cost of 310 basis points for FY21 and 190 bps for FY22. It pegs loan growth for the bank at 4 per cent for FY21 and 12 per cent for ROE is seen at 8 per cent for FY21 and 12 per cent for FY22.


M&M: Outperform
Shares of this automaker have 16 'buy' calls, 18 'outperform', two 'hold', one 'underperform' and two 'sell' calls. Phillip Capital expects M&M to benefit from relatively buoyant sentiment in the rural economy due to good Rabi harvest, expectation of high Kharif harvest and higher MSPs. The brokerage in a note said that light commercial vehicles are doing well and the launch of Thar followed by Scorpio and XUV500 facelifts should shore up personal vehicle volumes.

“The company continues to follow up on its commitment to address capital allocation concerns by being prudent and culling loss making subsidiaries gives us comfort,"" the brokerage noted. The stock is up 169 per cent since March 24 against Nifty's 75 per cent rise.


Tata Motors: Hold
In a note this week, Edelweiss said it is positive on JLR’s upcoming product pipeline, which will improve its mix towards the more profitable Land Rover brand. Demand across some of its key markets should normalise it said, adding that a tight cost control should bolster profitability.

""We believe the capex cycle has peaked and containing capex spend should also spur JLR’s FCF. For the India business, after two years of slowdown, we expect volumes to recover gradually,"" it said. FCF stands for free cash flow,"" it said. HDFC Institutional Equities has also upgraded the stock to ‘buy’. While brokerages are turning positive on the stock, the stock still has a consensus 'hold' rating, as per Reuters' Eikon database, following a 153 per cent rise since March 24.


Hindalco: Buy
This aluminium maker has 13 'buy' and 10 'outperform' calls, but no 'hold', 'underperform' or 'sell' calls. JM Financial said Hindalco’s strategic capital allocation in downstream rolling (Novelis, Aleris) has helped the company establish itself as a market leader in aluminium rolled products, revamping its legacy business model of being an aluminium manufacturer and reducing Ebitda volatility vis-à-vis peers in the process.

“India operations with its 90 per cent plus coal security stands to benefit disproportionately with the rise in LME aluminium price. Hindalco’s investment appeal comes from the rising volumes at Novelis enabling operating leverage to kick-in, FCF yield of 13-16 per cent over FY22E-FY23 making way for significant de-leveraging, now that the bulk of the capex is behind,"" it said. The stock is up 153 per cent since March 24.


JSW Steel: Hold
This steel stock has four 'buy', four 'outperform' 13 'hold', six 'underperform' and three 'sell' ratings. Analysts said while volume improvement is all likely, iron ore cost to the company may stay high despite improving integration, as captive iron ore is coming at a huge premium and would thus limit spread improvement. High debt and tendency for continuous expansion keeps them cautious following a 132 per cent rise in the stock since March 24. The company so far is not expecting net debt to increase in FY21, excluding that related to Bhushan power acquisition.


Grasim: Outperform
This auto stock has two 'buy', four 'outperform' and five 'hold' calls. It has no ‘underperform’ or ‘sell’ ratings, as per Reuters' database. Edelweiss said Grasim is a value play as its 57 per cent stake in UltraTech Cement alone, excluding the holding company, and exceeds its current market-cap by 46 per cent. “With the worst being largely behind for standalone business and management’s focus on prioritising capital for organic growth is positive,” the brokerage said.

The risk of investment in group companies like Vodafone Idea remains a key overhang and the reason behind the holding company discount, said Kotak Securities which has an 'add' rating on the stock. The stock is up 114 per cent since March 24.


RIL: Outperform
This stock has 11 'buy' calls, nine 'outperform' seven 'hold', four 'underperform' and one 'sell' ratings. Prabhudas Lilladher said the company's stated objective is to monetise and forge global partnership across businesses, is well positioned to incubate new business and pursue inorganic opportunities given its liquid balance sheet. “Despite a sharp run-up in stock prices, we believe positive news flow on global partnerships or stake sale is likely to keep valuations at elevated level,” it said in a note. This stock has gained 111 per cent since March lows.


Wipro: Underperform
The IT stock, which has rallied 100 per cent since March 24, is a consensus ‘underperform’, as per Reuters. At its analyst day, Wipro’s MD & CEO Thierry Delaporte shared his plan for a bolder Wipro and to revive the company's growth by having a high performance culture and simplification of its organisation structure. Following that, IDBI Capital has introduced its FY23 financials and forecast revenue and upgraded the stock's target to Rs 366 based on PE of 18 times FY23, which is near to the top-end of the one-year forward P/E range of 10-21 times in the last five years.

Hindalco Inds.,"Nov 15, 2020, 10:13 AM IST","Centre pushes for an expert dispute resolution panel aimed at resolving oil, gas wrangles","NEW DELHI: With an overhang of disputes choking investments in the oil and gas sector, the government is pushing for contractual wrangles being sent to an expert committee for time-bound resolution but the move has found few takers due to inherent conflict of interest in such a process, sources said. The government had in December last year constituted a 'Committee of External Eminent Persons/Experts' comprising former oil secretary G C Chaturvedi, former Oil India Ltd head Bikash C Bora and Hindalco Industries Ltd Managing Director Satish Pai, for dispute resolution without having to resort to the tardy judicial process. 

 But no major dispute has been referred to the panel so far, two sources with direct knowledge of the development said. 

 The panel has not inspired much confidence in oil and gas companies as most of their disputes are with the government over contractual interpretations and procedural issues. 

 And the very same government is not just deciding on how the dispute is to be resolved but also appointing members of the dispute resolution panel as well as setting its terms of reference, they said. 

 There is an inherent conflict of interest that has kept most disputes away from the committee, they said. 

 India's oil and gas sector has been plagued by disputes from cost recovery to production targets, and companies as well as the government have resorted to lengthy and costly arbitration followed by judicial review -- a process that takes years to resolve differences. 

 As per the official notification, the committee is to arbitrate on a dispute between partners in a contract or with the government over commercial or production issues for oil and gas. 

 ""Any dispute or difference arising out of a contract relating to exploration blocks/ fields of India can be referred to the committee, if both parties to the contract agree in writing for conciliation or mediation and further agree to not invoke arbitration proceedings thereafter,"" the December 2019 notification said. 

 Once a resolution has been referred to the panel, the parties cannot resort to arbitration or court case to resolve it. 

 Oil ministry's upstream technical arm, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) is to provide secretarial assistance to the Committee. 

 Sources said most of the disputes over terms and regulations around oil and gas fields are between companies and the DGH. 

 The panel, they said, was appointed without consultations with the industry. 

 Also, the ""government reserves the right to change the terms and conditions as and when required without assigning any reasons thereof"", the notification said. 

 The panel has a tenure of three years and the resolution is to be attempted to be arrived within three months. 

 The members and the parties may, however, extend the time for arriving at a settlement agreement by mutual agreement. 

 ""The members of the committee shall at all times remain impartial to the parties during the course of the conciliation or mediation proceedings,"" the notification had said. 

 The committee acting as conciliator or mediator will be allowed to take services of a third-party or expert agency to aid and assist it in discharge of its functions as and when required. 

 Upon receipt of a request referring dispute for resolution, the committee shall conduct the conciliation or mediation proceedings. ""The proceedings shall be based on the principles of fairness, justice and good conscience,"" it had said. 

 For the procedural aspect, the committee will be guided by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and the venue of the conciliation or mediation proceedings shall be New Delhi."
Hindalco Inds.,"Nov 12, 2020, 07:12 PM IST","Next round of commercial coal mine auction in January, says Coal Minister","New Delhi: Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi on Thursday said the Centre is planning to go for next round of auction of blocks in January and also appealed to the states to cooperate with commercial mine allottees to facilitate early operationalisation of the blocks as it would create a positive atmosphere and boost confidence of investors. 

 The statement assumes significance as of the total 35 coal mines successfully auctioned in the last 10 tranches of auction, only 14 blocks could begin operations. 

 ""I appeal to the state governments to cooperate (with the successful allottees of commercial coal mines auction),"" Joshi said in an interview to . 

 He said, ""Allow the 19 bidders which have been allotted blocks to operationalise the mines. Rest will also get confidence. So we will have to create such atmosphere. Cooperation means you (state) should get them (allottees) earlier clearances for the blocks...We want cooperation from state governments with regard to land acquisition, pollution control board."" 

 The minister further said that before the sale of blocks began, the Jharkhand government was of the view that if the auction took place during COVID-19 times, not much revenue would be generated. 

 But in contrast, he said the Jharkhand government will be receiving the highest revenue amongst all states, of Rs 2,690 crore per annum from the auctioned blocks. 

 ""The revenue (from the auctioned blocks) will come after a year...People will think of 30 years and participate in the coal auction. And you should not speak like this but encourage others,"" Joshi said. 

 Jharkhand had earlier expressed apprehensions about subdued participation from bidders during the auctions. 

The minister also exuded confidence that in the next round of auctions there would be participation from global players. 

The recent auction of coal mines for commercial mining witnessed ""fierce competition"" and the 19 blocks that went under the hammer can generate total revenues of around Rs 7,000 crore per annum and create more than 69,000 jobs once they are operationalised, Joshi had said. 

 The auction of blocks for commercial mining has opened the coal sector to the private players. 

 The auction of these mines witnessed fierce competition and companies have offered great premiums, he said. 

 Out of 38 mines put on auction, 19 mines were successfully auctioned. 

 Joshi had said 42 companies participated in the auction, out of which 40 were private players. 

 Total 76 bids were received for 23 mines, wherein 19 mines had received two or more bids and were found eligible for opening of technical bids. 

 For three mines, there were single bids. 

 In June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the auction process for 41 coal blocks for commercial mining. 

 Some of the corporate biggies that have bagged blocks include Adani Enterprises, Vedanta, Hindalco Industries and Jindal Power."

Outlook on Nifty 
The Nifty index witnessed wild swings during Wednesday’s trade with the index futures continuing to add fresh long positions. The index has retraced ~200 per cent of its previous down move and is currently trading in a superstructure Wave 3 phase of the Elliot theory. 

We expect the index to continue to face a marginal resistance at 12,800 level. However, as the overall structure continues to remain in the favour of bulls, a break above the mentioned resistance level could resume a fresh impulse move up to our eventual target price of ~13,400 by the end of 2020.

Investment RationaleDespite the surplus and high inventory in the primary aluminium space, the brokerage remains positive on sharp turnaround at Novelis. In its view, stable (and improving) margin from Novelis is likely to result in stable cash flow for Hindalco. Besides, continued deleveraging at Novelis (net debt/EBITDA already at 3.7x) is likely to keep balance sheet healthy. Taking cognizance of better-than-expected performance and prospects, it raises FY21/FY22E EBITDA for Hindalco by 17%/6%.

Hindalco Inds.,"Nov 10, 2020, 06:10 PM IST",Hindalco Q2 results: Net profit down 60% as Lewisport asset sale results in a loss,"Mumbai: Aditya Birla group’s flagship company Hindalco Industries Ltd has reported a Rs 387 crore consolidated net profit, a 60% year-on-year fallin the September quarter as against net profit of Rs 974 crore during the same quarter last year, mainly on account of one-time loss from Lewisport divestiture, the company said on Tuesday. Excluding its discontinued operations at Lewisport unit of Aleris, the company has posted a profit of Rs 1,785 crore, a jump of nearly 83% compared to the same period last year. Hindalco reported a loss of Rs 709 crore in the previous quarter owing to Covid-19 impacts.

 “We are not very satisfied with the fair value of the sale of Lewisport. We could have fetched around $560-580 million for those assets, however the expected synergy of $150 million from Aleris acquisition has gone up by $180 million,” said the company’s managing director, Satish Pai in an interaction. 

 As per the conditions laid down by the US Department of Justice, In order to acquire the assets of Aleris, the company had to divest Aleris’ plants in Lewisport, Kentucky, U.S.A., and Duffel, Belgium. The company has sold the plant to a private equity firm, American Industrial Partners for estimated net cash proceeds of about $171 million.

 With the addition of Aleris, the company was able to grow further in Asia market. The acquisition is expected to generate approximately $180 million in synergies, as against $150 predicted earlier and now the company will focus on deleveraging the balance sheet. “The integration work continues with $38 million run-rate acquisition cost synergies achieved to date, which will be going up in the coming quarters,” Pai said.

 Hindalco’s consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) registered a healthy growth of around 30% at Rs 5,171 crore as against Rs 3,918 crore during the same period last year, on account of favourable macros and lower input costs.

 “It is heartening to see a sharp recovery of demand to near pre-Covid levels in India Aluminium and Copper businesses. Novelis too sees a similar rise across segments, except for aerospace,” Pai said

 The company’s US subsidiary Novelis, through which the Aleris plant was acquired recorded a quarterly adjusted Ebitda of $455 million, up 80% against $253 million during the last quarter.

 “Novelis recorded a healthy Ebitda on the back of higher volumes, good cost control, better product mix and EBITDA contribution from the acquired Aleris business,” the company said in a statement.

 Hindalco reported revenue from operations of ₹31,237 crore in Q2FY21, up 5% from ₹29,657 crore in the year-ago period.

 The company’s copper cathode production reached 73 Kt from 41 Kt in Q1 FY21, up 76%, as a result of ramping up of operations, post recovery from Q1 disruptions due to Covid. Total copper metal sales were up 28% QoQ, at 75 Kt, as demand revived in Q2.

 Hindalco's yet another plant in Duffel, Belgium, was sold to Alvance, a GFG Alliance company for which The company has recorded a profit of ₹135 crore.

 “We have got 210 million euros and for the remaining 100 euros we will arbitrate, our position is quite strong in the region,” Pai said.

 Going forward the company's focus would be on deleveraging. In the end of September, it had a gross debt of $7 billion. Consolidated net debt to EBIDTA was at 3.52 times and 3.6 for Novelis. ""We will bring this down to less than 3 times by the end of FY23,"" said Pai.

The bulls have taken a strong grip and taken Nifty to a new high. The index has seen the highest ever close with handsome daily gains of around 200 points. The advance-decline ratio supports the market momentum along with a broadbased rally in most of the sectors.

It formed a bullish candle on the daily scale along with runaway gaps and continued to make higher highs and lows for the fifth session in a row.

Nifty opened negative on Thursday and witnessed a roller-coaster ride on day of October series F&O expiry. It remained highly volatile in range of 140 points between 11,606 and 11,744 zones. The index settled the session on a negative note with a loss of around 70 points and saw the lowest daily close in 17 sessions. The index formed a bullish candle as it closed higher than its opening level, but occurrence of a long upper shadow indicated that the bears are putting sustained pressure at higher levels amid weakness in global markets. 

The index has turned highly volatile in the last couple of sessions and got stuck in a wider range, where every decline got bought into while multiple hurdles were seen in the 11,950-12,020 zone. Now the index has to cross and hold above 11,750-11,777 zone to get the bull’s grip for a bounce towards 11,900 level, while on the downside major support exists in the 11,550-11,500 zone.

India VIX moved up 3.19 per cent from 23.28 to 24.02 level. With volatility moving upwards since last four consecutive weeks, the index needs to cool down for the market to stabilise ahead of the US election.

Since it is the beginning of new series, options data remained scattered at various strike prices. Maximum Put OI was seen at 11,000 followed by 11,500 level, while maximum Call OI was at 12,000 followed by 12,500 levels. Marginal Call writing was seen at 11,700 and 12,000 levels while there was Put writing at 11,600 and then 11,000 levels. Options data suggested a wider trading range between 11,200 and 12,000 levels.

Bank Nifty opened negative and witnessed a sharp zigzag movement throughout the day. It was a tug of war between the bulls and the bears to hold the banking index above or below 24,000 zone amid monthly expiry. It formed a High Wave Doji candle with long upper and lower shadows on the daily scale, which indicated a state of confusion in the rate-sensitive index. Now, it has to cross the 24,250 level to witness an upmove towards 24,750, while immediate key support was seen at 23,900 and then 23,750 and 23,500 levels.

Nifty futures closed negative with losses of 0.42 per cent at 11,672 level. The trade setup looked positive in Pidilite, Berger Paint, Muthoot Finance, Ramco Cement, Asian Paint, UltraTech Cement, SRF, Tata Chemicals, Kotak Bank and Ambuja Cement but it was weak in PEL, ONGC, PVR, Canara Bank, Hero Motocorp, Lupin and McDowell.

With the new changes MSCI India's weight in its emerging market index will increase to 8.7% from the current level of 8.1%.

Stocks such as Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Britannia, L&T and Nestle are likely to get an inflow between $100 and $ 200 million while Kotak Mahindra Bank, PI Industries and IPCA Laboratories are likely to be included in the MSCI EM index, according to a note by Morgan Stanley.

If included, Kotak Mahindra is expected to see an inflow of $ 502 million while IPCA Laboratories and PI Industries can see an inflow of about $100 million each. These stocks may remain under foreign fund manager’s radar over the coming weeks, which may give near-term appreciation in share prices. 


Kotak Mahindra Bank stock rallied 12% to Rs 1581 on Tuesday while IPCA Laboratories, Nestle, Muthoot Finance, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance among other surge over 5%.

Stocks such as Tech Mahindra, NTPC, Divi’s Labs, Cipla, Titan, Maruti Suzuki and Tata Steel may also see inflows between $ 77-100 million.

“Stocks that are being included tend to outperform in the run-up to their inclusion in key indices. Further, we observe that MSCI India index tends to outperform before and post the announcement,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley.

MSCI on Monday said it welcomes the recent disclosure of the FOL for Indian securities by National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) & Central Depository Services Limited (CDSL) addressing the concerns on the timeliness, quality and standardization of the data. The changes in the constituents for the MSCI indices will take place from December 1,2020.

The analysts also believe there is a high likelihood of inclusion of Apollo Hospitals NSE 3.18 % (potential inflows at $135 million) and L&T Infotech ($85 million); while medium likelihood for Muthoot Finance ($81 million).

In July, MSCI had deferred the decision to implement the FOL till further notice. On April 1 this year, India entered into a new regime on foreign limits where it increased the foreign portfolio investment (FPI) limits to sector foreign limits. Following that move, both NSDL and CDSL have revised foreign portfolio investment (FPI) limits for all listed stocks.

The MSCI index is a widely-tracked index for Indian stocks overseas with several passive funds replicating their portfolios according to the stock weightages that the index carries. These funds will be forced to buy or sell the stocks if the weight in the index is increased or reduced in the benchmark."
Asian Paints,"Oct 27, 2020, 12:48 PM IST","Vedanta, Asian Paints, Colgate among 34 stocks look set to rally, suggests MACD","NEW DELHI: Domestic stocks recovered on Tuesday, as investors judged Monday’s selloff excessive.

In fact, 34 stocks on NSE sent out bullish signals on the daily chart on Tuesday, as suggested by the moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, charts.

The momentum indicator signalled bullish crossovers — a sign of bullish undertone — on these counters, hinting at possible upsides in the days ahead. The list included stocks like Vedanta, Asian Paints, Colgate Palmolive, IPCA Labs and Exide Industries.

Tata Consumer, Snowman Logistics, NIIT, Birla Corporation, Gabriel India, Heritage Foods, Muthoot Capital, Omkar Speciality Chemicals and Wabco India are some of the other stocks reflecting the bullish sentiment.

ETMarkets.com
ETMarkets.comMACD is known for signalling trend reversals in traded securities or indices. It is the difference between the 26-day and 12-day exponential moving averages. A nine-day exponential moving average, called the ‘signal line’, is plotted on top of the MACD to indicate ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ opportunities.

When the MACD crosses above the signal line, it gives a bullish signal, indicating that the price of the security may see an upward movement and vice versa.

Data showed 16 stocks are showing bearish trends. They included HDFC Bank, GMR Infra, Jindal Stainless, Sudarshan Chemicals, Redington India, GIC Housing Finance, SRF and Somany Ceramics.

ETMarkets.comHowever, analysts say the MACD indicator should not be seen in isolation, as it may not be sufficient to take a trading call, just the way a fundamental analyst cannot give a ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ recommendation using a single valuation ratio.

This is because MACD is a trend-following indicator. Though traders can increase the sensitivity of MACD by using shorter moving averages for computing MACD (e.g. 5-day and 12-day moving averages), the lag effect will still be there.

Hence, traders should make use of other indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Series, candlestick patterns and Stochastic to confirm an emerging trend.

On Tuesday, shrugging off the overnight weakness in US stocks, Nifty50 reclaimed the 11,800 level in early trade, ahead of Thursday’s expiry of October series F&O contracts.

Unless this support zone is breached, the index is again likely to take a leap towards the 12,000 mark,” he said.

Asian Paints,"Oct 23, 2020, 08:31 AM IST",Asian Paints consolidated Q2 net rises 1% to Rs 852 crore,"Mumbai: Asian Paints beat market estimates to report a marginal improvement in profit for the September quarter, as a quick recovery in demand after the lockdown and favourable raw material prices boosted numbers for the nation’s largest paints maker. 

Consolidated net profit rose 1% from a year earlier to ₹852 crore, said a stock exchange filing. Analysts tracked by ET Now expected a profit of ₹720 crore. Revenue grew 6% to ₹5,350 crore. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation improved 33% to ₹1,265 crore on the back of stable raw material prices and internal cost optimisation measures.

“All business segments continued to witness improving demand conditions on a progressive basis during the second quarter,” managing director Amit Syngle said in a release. “Profitability across businesses was well supported by a better product mix, stable raw material prices, favourable foreign exchange rate and large number of cost optimisation measures put in place by the management. Pre-tax profit in the core paints business improved 29% on-year to ₹1,182 crore while losses in the home improvement segment narrowed to ₹4 crore from ₹16 crore a year earlier. 

“We estimate that Q3 and Q4 numbers will be even better for Asian Paints due to a huge pent-up demand in the initial phase of October,” said an analyst, requesting anonymity. 

The company’s shares recovered from the day’s low to a high of ₹2,114.95 after results were announced, before closing 0.65% down at ₹2,100.25 on the BSE Thursday.

“Asian Paints reported a very strong set of numbers. Sales were exactly in line with our expectations with double-digit volume growth in the decorative paints business. All parts of the country saw strong demand revival,” said Abneesh Roy, executive vice-president, Edelweiss Financial Services. “In terms of margins, it was an extremely good performance, with gross margin on standalone and consolidated basis broadly improving by 200 basis points (2 percentage points) on-year.” 

Analysts at Morgan Stanley forecast a bull trend for the company “which reflects medium- to long-term potential to gain market share from unorganised players and maintain strong growth with cost of equity at 11.1% and terminal growth at 6%.”"
Asian Paints,"Oct 22, 2020, 08:35 PM IST","Cost cutting, favourable forex rates help Asian Paints: Key Q2 takeaways","NEW DELHI: Asian Paints shrugged off pandemic fears and beat analyst estimates for September quarter earnings even though the profit growth was negligible.

The company said the profitability across businesses was well-supported by a better product mix, stable raw material prices, favourable foreign exchange rate and large number of cost optimization measures put in place by the management.


Here are key takeaways from the earnings:
How much did the company earn?Asian Paints said its net profits were flat year-on-year (YoY) at Rs 830.37 crore. Consolidated revenue from operations increased 5.93 per cent YoY to Rs 5,350.23 crore.


How did its paints and home improvement segment fare?The company said its home segment revenue rose to Rs 5,232.88 crore during the quarter from Rs 4,929.67 crore a year ago. Home improvement segment revenue stood at Rs 117.35 crore, down marginally from Rs 120.99 crore.


What is the situation regarding international business?
The international business portfolio did well supported by favourable market conditions in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, the company said. Nepal was an exception, which continues to witness challenging business conditions due to the pandemic.


Did the company announce any dividend?
The board of directors approved the payment of an interim dividend of Rs 3.35 per share. Last year, the company distributed the first interim dividend of Rs 3.35 per share in October 2019 for FY20. Total dividend of Rs 12 per share was distributed for FY20. The dividend payout ratio was 51.1 per cent for FY20. 


Management take
“All the business segments continued to witness improving demand conditions on a progressive basis during the second quarter of this financial year. The decorative business segment registered good volume growths for each of the months therefore seeing a healthy double digit volume growth for the quarter with demand picking up across regions. The other business segments in India including the two industrial coatings businesses and both the segments in the home improvement category also experienced improving trends in line with the phased out re-opening of the economy,” said Amit Syngle, Managing Director and CEO, Asian Paints.


Analyst takeThe numbers seem to be better than our expectation at least on the earnings front. IWhat we were expecting was a 7 per cent kind of volume growth and 6 per cent kind of sales growth. So at least, earnings numbers are better than what we were expecting,” said Sanjay Manyal of ICICI Securities. “That largely would have been due to the cost or rather significant decline in the raw material cost. Most of it would be the crude-based raw material cost and that would have helped the earnings,” the analyst added.

Business sentiments have also improved after a number of countries approved vaccines to be rolled out. Meanwhile, plans of strategic sales in government companies gave a fillip to PSU names.

“While the last week clearly belonged to the PSU Bank index and the FMCG index, the coming week could very well see outperformance of PSU stocks as the street braces itself for divestment news as well as hopes of higher dividend from cash-rich PSEs.

Shipping Corporation of India: The stock surged 30.16 per cent to Rs 83.95 after a media report said the government is likely to invite Expression of Interest (EoI) for the disinvestment of Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) by next week.


SpiceJet: The low-cost carrier was also among the top gainers, rising 18.87 per cent during the week to Rs 106.15 after the government raised the cap on air traffic and passenger to 80 per cent of the pre-covid level.


Indian Bank: The PSU bank climbed 17.45 per cent to Rs 85.8 after Indian Bank said that it made requisite accounting entries, setting off accumulated losses of Rs 18,975.53 crore from the share premium account of the bank.


Lemon Tree Hotels: Shares of the hotel chain company advanced 13.25 per cent to Rs 44.45 after vaccine approvals have begun improving sentiments. India is also likely to approve any of the vaccine candidates soon.


Dixon Technologies: The ongoing rally in Dixon Technologies is showing no signs of slowing down. The scrip rose further 11.11 per cent to Rs 12,659.20 during the week as India is trying to increase domestic manufacturing.


HDFC AMC: Shares of the asset manager climbed 9.72 per cent to Rs 2,841.70 as Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock from equal weight to overweight and raised price target to Rs 3,130 from Rs 2,235.

ITC,"Dec 10, 2020, 11:45 AM IST","Developers operating office spaces, hotels working on better air filtration to reassure employees & guests","New Delhi: Following growing evidence and research about the high likelihood of airborne transmission of the coronavirus, realty developers that operate Grade-A office spaces are working on better air filtration systems in a bid to provide greater assurance to employees as the Covid-19 pandemic rages on.

Chains such as ITC Hotels and Indian Hotels Company (IHCL) said the air filtration systems and processes put in place because of issues such as pollution in Delhi had assumed greater importance with the Covid-19 pandemic, as guests could be assured of cleaner and safer air.

Leading office space operators Max Estates, Bharti Realty, Kalpataru and DLF are working on revamped air filtration processes.

“At Max Towers, Noida, we have upgraded air filters. At the Okhla tower, we are installing five stages of air filtration, which will not only ensure clean indoor air but also keep the virus away,” Max Asset Services chief executive Rohit Rajput said.

DLF, which operates more than 32 million square feet of office space across the country, has invested in the MERV-14 range of air-filtration technology to improve indoor air quality.

Recommended by the American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), MERV-14 is said to be more than 90% efficient at capturing small particles (1 µm to 3 µm size range).

Since the coronavirus is found in respiratory droplets in nearly the same size range, MERV-14 can help purify the air in office, the company said.

“We are committed to making the safest comeback for employees, visitors and tenant organisations,” said Sriram Khattar, DLF Group’s managing director for the rental business.

Realty developer Kalpataru has installed the latest MERV air filters and UV lights across all air-handling units, to block and destroy pathogens and improve indoor air quality.

Bharti Realty, which operates Aerocity near Delhi airport, has installed (treated fresh air units) TFA, MERV-13 filters at all its properties to ensure conditioned fresh air for a dust- and virus-free environment.

“This is besides installing ESP filters at Wordmark-Aerocity, Bharti Crescent and Airtel Centre to take care of even 1-micron particles,” chief executive SK Sayal said.

The company has also designed basement ventilation for six to 12 air changes besides taking measures to ensure fresh air of 5 CFM (cubic feet/min) per person or 0.6 CFM per sq ft in the building. This is at par or better than the new ISHRAE Covid-19 recommendation for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, it said.

HC Vinayaka, vice president, technical, EHS and sustainability at ITC Hotels, said the air filtration technology put in place under the INHALE programme at ITC Maurya, Delhi would be rolled out at its hotels in Kolkata, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.

ITC adopted the technology of Swedish clean-air solutions company Campfil and retrofitted each air handling unit with MERV-15 filters. It also installed clinical HEPA filters. Plaques in public areas display the quality of air inside hotel premises.

“It is a capital-intensive process, but human life is beyond these things. Our air filtration systems can take care of even PM 1 particles, so we are much ahead of global standards,” said Vinayaka.

IHCL said at the recently revamped Machan and lobby areas in the relaunched Taj Mahal, Delhi, it had installed a Swedish technology air purification system to control air quality as per the guidelines of the World Health Organization.

“This mitigates the spread of harmful microbes and also maintains the indoor air quality. In addition, the H13 HEPA filter installed is a medical-grade air filter which removes particles and arrests airborne carriers,” IHCL said.

The room air cleaner is based on a ‘magnetic filter-less air purification process’ that helps in ensuring safety and health for guests from air pollution and airborne infectious diseases, the chain said.

The company’s newly launched The Connaught hotel in Delhi has installed electronic air filters that feed controlled quality air in the lobby, guestrooms, restaurants and meeting venues, it said."
ITC,"Dec 10, 2020, 06:45 AM IST","ITC is best in class on ESG, says Jefferies","ITC has a leading score on the environment, social and governance front across most Indian fast moving consumer goods and global tobacco firms, said Jefferies in a note. The brokerage has a buy rating on ITC with a target price of Rs 265.

""ITC is rated AA by MSCI on ESG, the highest among global tobacco players and better than most Indian FMCG companies. This is backed by its strong credentials — ITC has been carbon positive for 15 years, water positive for 18 years and solid waste recycling positive for 13 years,"" said Jefferies.

The foreign brokerage said ITC has aggressive future targets and intends to increase the share of renewable energy to 50 per cent from 41 per cent now, reduce specific energy consumption by 30 per cent and specific water consumption by 40 per cent over FY19 levels.

Under Jefferies' base case, ITC's cigarette EBIT is likely to see a 3 per cent annual growth over FY20-FY23 period and a 15 per cent growth in FMCG revenues.

""Cigarette margins are expected to expand by around 180bps over FY20-23 as increase in consumer prices should more than offset tax hikes, although at the cost of lower volumes. The agri, paperboard and hotel businesses, after seeing a decline in FY21 on account of Covid-19, are expected to see a sharper recovery in FY22,"" said Jefferies. 

Credit Suisse said ITC’s FMCG margins are within sight of what is considered acceptable FMCG margins and the company's cigarette business is trading at an implied valuation of 10 times which is lower than the brokerage's base case. Moreover, FY22 will be a post COVID recovery year for ITC's cigarette and hotels business, it said."
ITC,"Dec 09, 2020, 11:56 AM IST",ITC breaks key threshold to reclaim Rs 200: Will the stock come alive now?,"NEW DELHI: Over the past few months, there have been lots of debates about whether ITC can emerge an underdog on Dalal Street, with solid arguments from both sides.

Amid this debate, shares of FMCG major have broken a threshold this week and reclaimed the Rs 200 mark, cheering the investors who have been building positions in the stock for some time now. They include many fund houses and value investors.

The question is: will this breakout provide enough thrust to take the stock to a valuation at par with its peers? Or will the stock succumb to bear pressure and profit booking will ensue? Much like the Twitterverse, analysts are divided. 

“ITC continues to be a cigarette company and it will continue to trade in line with global cigarette companies. Though we may all argue about it being an FMCG company, and that FMCG part may be doing well, but as long as it is not reflected in the growth numbers, it will continue to be an underperformer. We have a ‘neutral’ rating on the stock and would rather prefer to be with some of the better stories in the FMCG space,” said Hemang Jani, Equity Strategist & Senior Group VP, Motilal Oswal.

ITC, despite growing rapidly in the FMCG space, is heavily dependent on its cigarette business for cash flows.

Jani’s analysis shows even if the FMCG-related business grows at 50 per cent from FY20 to FY23, the contribution of the cigarette business would not be reduced much from 85 per cent in FY20, and it will at best go down to 82 per cent. Plus, there is a possibility of a GST hike on cigarette in the next Budget, which could be a bit of a dampener for the stock.

Another argument that goes against the stock is that in an increasingly ESG-compliant world, the company may not find too many investors, as they will avoid stocks that are into sin businesses. In the near term, that is not a major worry, as many mutual funds have hiked stake on this counter. Retail investors’ holding on the counter has also risen in the last few quarters.

Parag Parikh Long Term Equity is one such fund that has bought heavily into the counter, taking its holding to as high as 7 per cent of the total portfolio. The fund is managed by value investor Rajeev Thakkar. With a 30 per cent year-to-date return, the stock has outperformed most of its peers so far in 2020.

In a recent interview, Thakkar said he is betting on ITC’s long-term underperformance which has increased attractiveness of the stock from a valuation point of view. Plus, its FMCG business is also coming out of the gestation period and margin recovery is in the offing.

Deven R Choksey, another value investor and MD of KR Choksey Investment Managers, also sees the company as a good long-term play. He is bullish on the stock but says the company could do well to demerge the FMCG business to unlock value.

“ITC definitely remains a favourable pick from an investment point of view. But if you want to draw new funds into the businesses, the requirement here would be to demerge the FMCG business into the separate company,” he said. 

Return wise, the stock is still in the red year to date, but is up over 40 per cent from its March low point. In last one month, the stock has risen over 20 per cent.

A Reuters compilation of analyst opinions showed 27 of them are bullish with either ‘buy’ or ‘outperform’ ratings, six have assigned a ‘hold’ rating and just one analyst expects it to underperform."

ITC,"Nov 20, 2020, 01:27 PM IST","Piece of cake: Pandemic sweetens cake sub-segment, attracts bigwigs","New Delhi: Pandemic-induced acceleration in consumption of bakery items has attracted food majors to venture into the ""sweet and convenient"" sub-category of packaged cake segment.

At present, the industry estimates the sub-segment's revenue generation capacity of over Rs 2,500 crore per annum.

In the recent past, major food segment players such as Mondelez-owned Cadbury, ITC Sunfeast, and others have entered into this niche category.

Accordingly, market observers cited food safety, in-house consumption and differentiated product offerings as the prime factors for the over 20 per cent annum revenue growth of the sub-segment.

""The current pandemic has led to some profound shifts in buying patterns and consumer preferences,"" said Madhur Singhal, Practice Leader - Consumer and Retail, Praxis Global Alliance.

""Cakes also produce a higher price realisation per unit of raw material consumed. Therefore, it is not surprising that packaged food brands are looking at doubling down on this product category,"" he added.

A case in point is the ITC Sunfeast, which had forayed into the cake segment in 2018.

""Within two years after leading category growth in the layered cakes segment, with a 22 per cent market share, Sunfeast decided to expand its cakes portfolio and consolidate it under a new sub-brand 'Sunfeast Caker', which we have just launched,"" said Ali Harris Shere, Chief Operating Officer, Biscuits & Cakes Cluster, Foods Division, ITC.

""The cake category in India has been growing at a very promising pace. Given that it is a large category, and with our experienced play in the biscuits segment, we believe it is the right time to expand our foothold in the segment.""

According to Pinakiranjan Mishra, Partner and National Leader, Consumer Products and Retail, EY India: ""The bakery industry in India is driven by changing customer preferences and lifestyles. There is higher demand for healthier products and alternatives post Covid-19 as bakery products are now frequently consumed daily as compared with being a treat.""

""The outlook for the Indian bakery industry seems quite optimistic, with the projected market value likely to surpass $12 billion by 2024, growing at a CAGR of 9.3 per cent between 2019 and 2024."""
ITC,"Nov 20, 2020, 12:11 PM IST",9 Nifty stocks 100-340% down from peak prices: Should you buy?,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmark Nifty might have made an all-time high at 12,948 this week, but hitting such record levels seems like a distant dream for nine index stocks, which need to gain 100-338 per cent to revisit their previous peaks.

Many of these stocks are on analysts’ ‘buy’ list, though none of them promises to make fresh highs for now, if one were go by analyst targets.


ONGC: This stock settled at Rs 71.90 on Wednesday and needs a 338 per cent rally to revisit its all-time high of Rs 314 hit on June 9, 2014. BoB Capital Markets said the stock’s underperformance despite the recent rise in oil prices provides valuation comfort, especially amid the decline in operating costs.

“As oil prices remain strong, we find the risk-reward favourable and upgrade the earnings estimates. As cash flows improve amid a decline in leverage, we see a strong probability of either higher dividend payout or share buyback going forward,” the brokerage said. It suggested a price target of Rs 104 on the stock. Edelweiss has a price target of Rs 100. Motilal Oswal Securities sees the stock at Rs 90 while IDBI Capital has a target of Rs 85.


Coal India: Coal India requires a 270 per cent rally to hit the August 2015 high of Rs 447. This stock is a ‘buy’ for Emkay Global, but with a lower target price of Rs 180 against Rs 208 earlier amid concerns over low e-auction premiums.

Taking cognisance of lower cash accretion, Edelweiss has cut its price target for Coal India to Rs 155 from Rs 165.
The stock closed at Rs 120.75 on Wednesday. “Realisations from e-auction and volume growth have been under pressure on account of a decline in power demand and significant stocks at both mines and power plants. However, power demand has shown signs of improvement, and we expect volumes to recover in 2HFY21,” Motilal Oswal said and recommended a price target of Rs 192 on the stock.


Tata Motors: The stock needs a 249 per cent rise over its Wednesday’s price to revisit the February 2015 high of Rs 605 apiece. HDFC Securities last week upgraded the stock to ‘Buy’ rating from ‘Add’, as it expects the OEM to benefit from improving demand outlook, cost-cutting initiatives and better FCF generation. “JLR’s retail volumes are improving from Covid lows, and system inventories are normalising,” it said and recommended a price target of Rs 175 on the stock. Phillip Capital said the company has turned the corner and the worst is behind it. This brokerage has a price target of Rs 167 on the stock. The stock traded at Rs 173 on Wednesday, suggesting muted upside potential. 


NTPC: NTPC needs a 174 per cent gain to reach its March January 2008 high. Analysts have a ‘strong buy’ recommendation on the stock. In a recent note, IIFL said NTPC valuations are very undemanding at 0.7 times FY21E PBV and it comes with an attractive dividend yield of 6.4 per cent. “The regulated RoE of 15.5 per cent till FY24E and commercialisation of capacities provide good earnings visibility and will lend support to the stock price,” it said. Kotak Securities finds the fair value of the stock at Rs 125. The stock closed at Rs 88.30 on Wednesday.


IndianOil: IOC requires a 172 per cent jump to hit the August 2017 high. JP Morgan has March 2021 price target of Rs 140 on the stock, while UBS’s 12-month target stands at Rs 130 and Prabhudas Lilladher’s at Rs 118. IOC hit a record high of Rs 231.47 on August 31 2017, as per corporate database AceEquity.

Nirmal Bang’s buy call on IOC is based on improved outlook for retail margins, a likely recovery in refining and petchem margins in next 1-2 years due to likely closure of capacities and compelling valuation after a sharp 45 per cent drop in the stock price in last one year, which has priced in worries over margins and the likely risk of rising competition from private retailers/alternative fuels.


IndusInd Bank: At Rs 828, shares of IndusInd Bank are trading higher than JM Financial’s price target for the stock at Rs 750, Nomura’s target of Rs 725 and Edelweiss’ target of Rs 665. Up 125 per cent in the last six months, this stock is still down 45 per cent year to date. Edelweiss said concerns over asset quality will dominate IndusInd’s core business momentum gains in the foreseeable future. “Demonstration of the merger value-add and getting through the current crisis without earnings erosion thereof are key,” it said.


Sun Pharma: ICICI Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 610. Prabhudas Lilladher sees the stock at Rs 597, JPMorgan at Rs 600, JM Financial at Rs 770 and Macquarie at Rs 620. The stock has 32 ‘buy’, 2 ‘hold’ and 5 ‘sell’ ratings. 

Emkay Global said while the company management has indicated that the reduction in sales and promotional expenses is not structural, it expects the Ebitda margin to remain at around 25 per cent in the near term, as other expenses are likely to moderate in third and possibly fourth quarters. This brokerage has a price target of Rs 560 on the stock. Specialty sales growth, Halol plant resolution and recovery in the branded markets are seen as key driver for the Sun Pharma stock, analysts said.


GAIL: Prabhudas Lilladher expects GAIL’s capex trajectory to pick up as all businesses (excluding pipeline) operate at near-peak levels. A weak commodity price outlook amid uncertain demand recovery remains a key risk, it said and suggested a price target of Rs 108 on the stock. IDBI Capital has a price target of Rs 109 on the stock while JM Financial sees it at Rs 125.

“Given the weakness in share price, the prevailing market price is implying zero value for its gas trading and petchem/LPG businesses due to low earnings visibility. “Hence, we maintain a buy rating as the valuation provides a margin of safety,” JM Financial said.


ITC: Antique, IIFL, Elara, Jefferies, Kotak Institutional Equities and CLSA, among others, have ‘buy’ ratings on the stock with price targets ranging from Rs 235 to Rs 273. At 14.5 times FY22 earnings, the stock valuation appears to be compelling while a higher payout implies an attractive 5 per cent dividend yield, Jefferies said and maintained a price target of Rs 265 on the stock.

Geojit expects an improvement across ITC’s verticals in the months ahead. “However, the pace of pickup in volumes and demand remains crucial,” it said as it valued the stock at Rs 217."

ITC,"Nov 10, 2020, 09:42 AM IST","Next quarter may be better for ITC, but only in parts","ET Intelligence Group: The Covid pandemic has exposed the weakness of ITC’s business model. 

While the at-home FMCG products and agribusiness did well, other segments — cigarettes, hotels and educational and stationery products —have borne the impact of local lockdowns in the September quarter.

Consequently, despite a sequentially better performance, net sales at ITC rose 1.2% while net profit dropped 20% for the quarter — the second consecutive decline in several three-month periods.

Cigarette sales dropped nearly 4% compared to the year-ago level, with 880 bps decline in margins. Cigarette volumes are estimated to have dropped by around 12%.

The FMCG business, the management’s current focus area, has emerged as the best piece of ITC’s performance. The segment posted the highest quarterly sales and 300 bps expansion in Ebitda to 9.7% — being the only segment posting an improvement in margins.

The comparable revenue of the segment, excluding the education and stationery portfolio, was up over 18%. Antiseptic and disinfectant brand Savlon is slated to become a ₹1,000 crore brand this fiscal.

In the case of the agriculture segment, while the revenues were up by ₹337 crore over the year-ago level, the margins dropped over 80 bps.

ITC’s investors have been a disappointed lot this year, and they are likely to show their displeasure by selling the stock. The ITC stock is already down 27% year to date and is among the worst performers in the FMCG sector. 

Its peers in different segments — HUL, Nestle, Britannia and Godfrey Phillips — have performed better. The ITC stock is trading at a price to earnings multiple of 15 — the lowest among FMCG companies.

With the overall performance adversely impacted, the success of the FMCG business may do little to brighten its allure. The current quarter is likely to be better given the onset of winter, which could boost sales of personal products. However, segments such as cigarettes and hotels may continue to remain affected in the near term. Besides, the possibility of an increase in taxation on cigarettes in the forthcoming GST council meetings remains an overhang."

Hind. Unilever,"Dec 02, 2020, 11:23 PM IST",Markets like India added most to margins: Unilever,"MUMBAI: British consumer giant Unilever said some of its largest businesses including in India added the most to its margin in recent years, in contrast with the view that the company’s focus on higher sales growth could hurt the margin. 

Unilever, at the Morgan Stanley Global Consumer and Retail virtual conference on Tuesday, said the minority view was that the company needed to reset its margin in order to improve the market share. 

""But some of our fastest growing and most competitive businesses have been with the largest contributors to our significant margin in the last few years. Our Indian business increased its Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) by nearly 900 basis points, growing an average 9% in the last 10 years with 75% of the business growing share,"" chief financial officer Graeme Pitkethly said.

The Indian unit, Hindustan Unilever, is the country’s largest consumer products firm and its performance is considered a proxy for broader consumer sentiment in the local market. Last fiscal year, its Ebitda of Rs 9,600 crore and margin at 25.1% were the highest on record.

In an interaction with ET in October, HUL chairman Sanjiv Mehta had said it had shifted focus to absolute profit and volume share rather than just growing value and margins. Last quarter, HUL reported a 150-basis-point (or 1.5-percentage-point) fall in its gross margin, even as the Ebitda margin rose 30 bps due to cost saving initiatives and synergies from the merger of GlaxoSmithKline’s Indian consumer business with it."

The company, which completed its acquisition of GSK Consumer in April this year, said Akshay Kumar will represent the core values of the brand and encourage urban Indian adults to fight protein deficiency everyday.

“Indian diet sometimes may be insufficient to meet the RDAs of protein and what we need to create awareness for is that for every 1 kg of healthy body weight, one requires 1 g of protein every day. Protein deficiency in adults can lead to impaired immune system, hair fall, accumulation of fat and so on. There is a need for us to move to the next frontier in the battle for an optimal protein intake and the relaunch of Horlicks Protein Plus, our adult nutrition brand, is a step towards the initiative,"" Sudhir Sitapati, Executive Director, Foods & Refreshment, HUL said.

In December 2018, it was announced that GSK Consumer Healthcare will merge with HUL an all-stock deal, valuing the Indian unit of GSK at Rs 31,700 crore. Horlicks has over half the malted beverages market in India, and was acquired to help HUL’s focus in building a profitable and sustainable nutrition business in the country.

“Fitness is not something that you achieve by just getting to the gym and putting in hours of workout. A wholesome life is a combination of rest, a healthy mental state and eating right with it. Sadly, most people don’t have the right information about the diet they consume! For example, protein is thought of as just a body building supplement and the multiple other benefits of it are widely unknown,"" said Akshay Kumar."

Most of these companies said they will hike their advertising spending in the second half of the fiscal and are going forward to continue demand generation now that several of them have also entered multiple new categories during the pandemic.

As per Nielsen, a record 9700 new products were rolled out during April-September period with most companies entering new categories like health and hygiene, home care and packaged food.

One of India’s largest advertiser, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), has increased advertising spending which also includes promotion on the rebranding of Glow & Lovely and brands acquired from GSK Consumer.

Similarly, Britannia has increased advertising spending on brands which had stock, SKUs and availability all across, while overall spending is getting close to normal. Brands like Amul, LG and Dabur said they are increasing their advertising spending over last year.

""I think it is the right time to continue to invest, and we are comfortable to invest to really drive demand generation,"" said Srinivas Phatak, chief financial officer at HUL.

“We are focusing on getting the right share of voice. And therefore, we have spent. And if I look at the December quarter, our objective would be to continue to invest further behind our brands,"" said Pathak, during a recent earning call.

Britannia MD Varun Berry said advertising and sales promotion spending, which was finally returning back to normal levels. He said spending had taken a backseat since there were not enough products to sell.

Berry said Britannia will focus on advertising on brands like Good Day, Marie and Milk Bikis, which are highly profitable and also right priced, during the earnings call. 




ITC is going to sequentially increase its spending on advertising in the second half of the fiscal. 

FMCG advertising spending is usually determined by their percentage to overall sales, which had gone down during the Covid disruption and subdued discretionary spends. However, demand has recovered for a lot of categories since August, marketers said.

Marico managing director, Saugata Gupta, said advertising spend at 9.5% of sales is almost back to pre-Covid levels. “We will continue to invest behind growth and market share in core and scale the new mass offerings in foods,” he said.

India’s largest appliance maker, LG India, had doubled its advertising spending for the just concluded festive season and is now finalising the budget for the period till March which would also see an increase, said vice president Vijay Babu.

The country’s largest dairy company, Amul managing director RS Sodhi said it was increasing advertising spending by 10-15% for this fiscal. “The spending mix which had shifted to digital and TV is now back to pre-Covid with print media getting back to normal,” he said.

The rapid expansion of consumer companies during Covid will also drive advertising.

Emami director Mohan Goenka said it has set in place an aggressive budget for the new launches, particularly in the second half of the fiscal that should increase the advertising spending by about 200-basis points.

Dabur CEO Mohit Malhotra said the company is now trying to get into categories which are much larger than where it was already prsent, as Covid has taught that it also has to pivot the business to categories which are larger and which will give the scale leverage.

""Therefore, we have to invest the upsides into advertising…So in terms of the long term, two to three years of horizon, we are wanting to invest in advertising,” he said."

From Covid insurance coverage, awareness generating initiatives, to connecting regularly with individual shop floor members and their families to address issues around physical and mental well-being, the FMCG major has initiated a bunch of programmes that covers its 11,000 shop floor workers and around 30,000 indirect workers. 

“Our HR teams made sure we reached out to each and every member of the field force…we believe that as people are geographically dispersed we have to make that much more effort to reach out to them and address any issues related to well-being,” said Anuradha Razdan, executive director – HR at HUL. 

The company has extended Covid-19 insurance coverage to all its employees across factories and distribution centres.

“For all our factory employees as well as 30,000 employees in our outer core - that is people who are not our direct employees - we made sure that we offer best in class Covid insurance,” she said.

The company is also working at the community level - generating awareness not only among the workers but the local community they live in.

“One of the biggest issues while our factories kept running was that how do these people come to work without the fear of social boycott because of the fear that the person who is going out to work may bring back the infection from outside when coming back home,” Razdan told ET in an exclusive interaction. “So we not only focused on generating awareness among the employees but also building awareness and advocacy among the communities where they live,” she added.

In addition to this, the entire factory leadership team keeps regular connection with the workers and their families. On a weekly basis, members from the leadership team connect with every employee.

“We have 10-15 members in our factory leadership teams and between them they took ownership of every blue collar employee. In some factories there are as many as 2000 blue collar employees. We made sure that someone from the leadership team is doing regular connect with the shop floor employees on the phone talking to them or their families,” said Razdan. The focus of this initiative is to build trust by disseminating awareness about the safety of the site, giving them information on health and hygiene, and building a connection with their families. “This care-to-connect programme we did in more than 30 of our manufacturing sites and in every factory we ensured that the leadership teams mapped themselves to individual employees and covered their families.”

""Unilever has confirmed that preliminary lab test results show that mouthwash formulation containing CPC Technology reduces 99.9 per cent of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, after 30 seconds of rinsing,"" the company said in a statement.

The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose, which has been detected before, during, and after the acute phase of illness, as well as in asymptomatic cases.

""Therefore, reducing the viral load in the mouth could help to reduce transmission. The findings indicate that mouthwash could become an important addition to other everyday protective measures like handwashing, physical distancing and mask wearing,"" it added.

Unilever Oral Care Research and Development Head Glyn Roberts said, ""While we are clear that this is not a cure or proven way to prevent the transmission of coronavirus, our results are promising.""

Roberts added that given the critical stage of the pandemic, the company feels it is important to share the results of the mouthwash.

This technology will be brought to India by Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), Unilever's arm, in Pepsodent Germicheck Mouth Rinse Liquid, which will be launched in India in December 2020, the company said.

Unilever said the test for its mouthwash containing CPC (cetylpyridinium chloride) technology was conducted by an independent and internationally accredited testing facility, Microbac Laboratories, on behalf of Unilever Research Laboratories in the US.

CPC is a widely used cosmetic ingredient, also used by the dental industry, and is known for its antibacterial and anti-virus benefits.

The test focussed on both 30 and 60 seconds rinse times, aiming to replicate the real-life use of mouthwash in an in-vitro context.

Unilever,"Nov 12, 2020, 08:15 AM IST",Return of the kirana store: Number of neighbourhood shops back to pre-Covid levels,"MUMBAI/KOLKATA: The number of neighbourhood groceries exceeded the pre-Covid count for the first time since March, indicating robust revival for a crucial distribution channel that sells three-fourths of the cookies, staples, packaged snack-foods, cooking oils or other provisions consumed in India.

Bizom, a sales automation firm that transacts with 7.5 million retail stores, said operational kirana stores fell to a fourth in April after Covid-induced curbs, liquidity challenges and reverse migration forced millions of neighbourhood shops to shut down. However, the store count has gradually risen and was about 8% higher in October compared to the pre-Covid months of January and February.

""Sales from kiranas more than compensated for the loss in modern trade business. There is a 20-25% surge in average purchase value in kiranas since the usual shoppers at modern trade outlets are buying from them,"" said B Krishna Rao, senior category head at Parle Products, the country's leading cookies maker.

With many local stores shutting, most companies saw their distribution affected during the initial days despite higher demand, especially for personal hygiene and food products. However, they were hopeful that a large part of the store closures could be temporary and they may come back progressively as the lockdown eases.



Due to fewer stores, average monthly purchase surged at kiranas with each store serving three times more shoppers at the peak of operational curbs. The number has normalised last month, indicating that consumers can access a wider store network now. 

""We see that a kirana now serves 290 people on an average versus 1,046 consumers in April,"" said Akshay D'Souza, chief marketing officer at MobisyTechnologies that owns Bizom. ""While kiranas are picking up slowly in the top 75 cities as economic activity shows an uptick, rural and suburban India drove higher sales than before lockdown started.""

Companies also said contribution from online channels doubled over the past six months, and ecommerce has also taken share from modern trade or supermarkets.

In its latest investor presentation, ITC said that modern trade footfalls and sales are still growing at a slower pace and e-commerce has also grown due to an increasing digital adoption by kiranas. ITC’s executive director (FMCG businesses), B Sumant, said neighbourhood outlets have been the saviour for residential communities during the pandemic. ""Products are stocked with high priority in kiranas,"" he added.

Even Hindustan Unilever said more than 2.7 lakh stores are now buying through its ordering app Shikhar. ""While the pandemic saw e-commerce reach an inflection point, it has also marked the renaissance of the humble nex- door grocer,"" HUL chairman Sanjiv Mehta said during an earnings call last month."

Unilever,"Oct 28, 2020, 09:18 PM IST",Growth of e-commerce in grocery channels irreversible; will co-exist with general trade: HUL CMD Sanjiv Mehta,"New Delhi: Growth of e-commerce in the grocery segment is ""irreversible"" but kirana stores and modern trade channels would also remain relevant, Hindustan Unilever CMD Sanjiv Mehta said on Wednesday.

Mehta also said rural sales are growing faster than the urban markets and would sustain depending on the support provided by the government.

The recent farm reforms are in the right direction and would result in more technology and capital for the sector, he added.

""The growth of the e-commerce is clearly irreversible but the way I look at India, general trade, modern trade, e-commerce will co-exist and India is not a country where the general trade would disappear, let's be absolutely clear about that,"" said Mehta.

He was speaking at a panel discussion at 'Massmerize 2020', a conference organised by industry body FICCI.

The share of general trade, which includes small shops and kirana stores, may come down but it would be a ""fatal mistake"" to write its obituary, Mehta emphasised.

""No, it is not going to happen and even after 10 years, the biggest channel would be general trade,"" he said.

Mehta, who is also the vice president of FICCI and chairs the FICCI FMCG Committee, said Indian general trade is ""unique in many ways"" and the cost of distribution is on its side.

""The cost of distribution in the grocery channels is absolutely fine....During this period, we have seen the benefit of proximity. People have gravitated to the nearby grocery shops because of the sheer convenience,"" he pointed out.

However, he added that general trade would also be digitised and connected.

Talking about modern trade, he said that after two decades, it has now firmly established itself.

He agreed with METRO Cash & Carry India Managing Director and CEO Arvind Mediratta, who earlier at the event said people go to modern trade outlets like malls and hypermarkets for the sheer experience.

""As modern trade goes to tier II and III cities, it is going to fillip in those cities and omni channel is going to be a bigger part of modern trade channels for the sheer convenience and benefits,"" Mehta added.

Echoing his views, Hershey India Managing Director Herjit S Bhalla, who was moderating the session, said general trade is going to stay and it is also adopting modern techniques.

""General trade is going to stay and its not going anywhere. If we actually look back at it, there is lot of e-com kind of behaviour by general trade as they are delivering on a phone call and talks to you,"" he said.

Even during the peak of the lockdown, it was general trade which emerged as the saviour for people due to its proximity, he added.

P&G India Sub-Continent CEO and MD Madhusudan Gopalan said the online segment's share is going to increase.

""There is going to be work to be done, both on the part of the online retailers and also on part of brands if you want to keep this trajectory growing,"" he added.

On rural sales, Mehta said the runway to grow in rural India is massive.

Rural markets are showing higher growth in FMCG sales than urban areas, he said, adding that the recent farm reforms would lead to higher incomes in the rural areas."

Analyst Name: Dharmesh Shah – Head Technical
The weekly price action formed an inside bar, indicating extended breather near the psychological mark of 12,000. Going ahead, we expect the index to extend the ongoing consolidation in the broad range of 12,000-11,500 in the coming week. 

Volatility is likely to remain high ahead of the monthly expiry and the US elections. However, the current breather and the rise in volatility should not be seen as negative, as broader price structure remains robust. We do not expect Nifty to breach the 11,500 mark. Therefore, any declines led by events would offer an incremental buying opportunity. 

Broader markets, on expected lines, have relatively outperformed the benchmark during the previous week. We expect the broader market to endure its relative outperformance amid ongoing Q2FY21 result season.

Buy Bharat Electronics


CMP: Rs 90
Target: Rs 96
Stop loss: Rs 86.5
Rationale:


Stocks from the PSU space have seen aggressive short additions in the last couple of months as they have failed to perform in line with the market. Bharat Electronics, which has remained under pressure and moved from the highs of Rs 120 in mid-August to sub Rs 90 levels in October has accumulated significant short additions in the system. 
The open interest in the stock has risen by almost 20% since August. Also, despite intermediate closure of positions, overall short bias remained intact. We believe the recent short positions in the stock are still intact and will be covered near the support zone of Rs 85-90 levels.

Rationale:


After forming a support near Rs 1,300, Interglobe Aviation managed to move towards the higher band of the range. During the recent consolidation seen in the stock, continued closure of positions was seen. 
The stock is likely to move above its highest Call base of Rs 1,400 towards settlement and initial signs of closure are visible at its highest Call base of Rs 1,400 strike. We expect the stock to find momentum in the short-term.

“There’s been a pickup in economic activity and the marketplace in India after a very strong lockdown in the first half,” Unilever chief financial officer Graeme Pitkethly told investors during an earnings call. “It looks like we are over the hump in India in terms of the economy and the market growth numbers.” The maker of Dove shampoo and Lifebuoy soaps posted sales of 4.4% during the September quarter with sales in emerging markets rising 5.3%.

Unilever’s commentary marks a reversal from a quarter ago when it said rising Covid cases were a worrying trend in India and its local unit, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, saw a 7% drop in sales in the April-June quarter.




Improvement in Demand
It reported a 16% growth in sales in the September quarter on October 20, helped by the acquisition of GSK Consumer. Excluding the integration, revenue rose 3%, boosted by the relaxation of restrictions on manufacturing and distribution.

“The business in India did really well to grow in single digits,” Pitkethly said. “This quarter again was driven by hygiene products and our food refreshment portfolio in India which is now very, very strong with the acquisition of Horlicks and we are very excited about the prospects for foods in India going forward.”

Unilever said economic performance is largely dependent on countries choosing between opening up to safeguard jobs and protect businesses or imposing further lockdowns to curb infections and save lives.

In India, the lockdown imposed on March 25 saw many shops shutting and sales being restricted to essentials. Curbs began to be eased in May but mini shutdowns were enforced in various states because of Covid-19 outbreaks starting July.

However, HUL, the country’s biggest consumer goods company, has seen progressive improvement in demand, with India unlocking in stages and rural areas continuing to perform better on the strength of good monsoons. The company’s performance is considered a proxy for broader consumer sentiment in India.

HUL said Tuesday that urban markets were impacted due to limited mobility, while rural sales continued to grow. “If there is no further outbreak, then the worst is behind us. All the steps that the government has taken are clearly visible in the fact that rural consumption has remained resilient,” HUL chairman Sanjiv Mehta had said."

Can they add to gains?,"MUMBAI: As benchmark Nifty ruled at a record high on Wednesday, six of its components scaled all-time highs this week. Here’s a quick look at these top performers, and what has driven them up.


Adani Ports and SEZ: The Adani Group stock scaled a record high, as analysts upped their price targets on the private multi-port operator, on the back of a faster-than-expected turnaround in its recently acquired Krishnapatnam Port. The stock has gained 30 per cent year to date, and is up more than 134 per cent from its March lows.


Bajaj Finance: With Bajaj Finance shares ruling at record high levels, investors are now anxious if this multibagger will continue the uptrend. However, the stock has seen fatigue set in after multiplying nearly three times from its March lows. The Sensex stock had tumbled more than 50 per cent in March, when the onset of Covid-19 pandemic rattled markets, and had tumbled to a 52-week low of Rs 1,783.10 on May 27. Since then, it has risen nearly 3 times.


Kotak Mahindra Bank: This private lender scaled a record high on Wednesday, performing gradually but consistently on the bourses. Earlier this week, RBI approved the re-appointment of Uday Kotak as the bank’s Managing Director for a further period of three years. The stock is up 16 per cent for the year to date, and has recovered more than 95 per cent from its March lows.


Titan: Big Bull Rakesh Jhunjhunwala’s prized possession Titan has hit a record high, buoyed by robust festive season sales, and as investors preferred industry leaders in a market where valuations have entered the expensive zone. The stock is up 27 per cent year to date, and has more than doubled from its 52-week low hit in March.


Asian Paints: The country’s top paint maker has been true to its multibagger tag, and has been hitting new highs. At the start of second half of 2020, the stock started recovering on the back of pentup demand after the lockdown curbs eased. Amit Syngle, MD & CEO told ETNow that sustainable new demand has emerged. The stock has gained 45 per cent for the year to date, and is up more than 80 per cent from March lows.


Nestle India: The fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firm logged new highs, riding the wave of urban as well as rural demand. The stock is up 24 per cent year to date, and is up more than 50 per cent from its March lows."
Adani Ports SEZ,"Dec 16, 2020, 12:06 PM IST","MFs sold 80% of Nifty stocks in Nov, but grabbed remaining 10","NEW DELHI: Mutual funds were seen paring stakes in 80 per cent of the Nifty50 stocks in November, the month that saw these institutional investors selling Rs 30,760 crore worth of shares on Dalal Street.

Bajaj Finserv, IndusInd Bank, Nestle India and Tata Steel were among the stocks that saw biggest drops in MF holdings, while Adani Ports, Dr Reddy's Labs and HCL Technologies were among a few that saw buying by the desi fund managers during the month.

One of the stocks that saw the biggest selloff by MFs was Bajaj Finserv. Mutual fund holding in terms of number of Bajaj Finserv shares held by 19 mutual funds declined 18.9 per cent during the month to 46 lakh shares.

Mutual funds' total holding in the stock was valued at Rs 4,060 crore at the end of the month, a study by Motilal Oswal Securities showed.

In the case of IndusInd Bank, the number of shares MFs held in the bank fell 16.7 per cent month-on-month to 5.21 crore shares. MF holding on this counter stood at Rs 4,470 crore at the end of the month.

MFs sold 13 per cent of their holdings in Nestle India; 12.8 per cent of their holdings in Tata Steel and 10.3 per cent in Tech Mahindra. Hero MotoCorp, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Britannia Industries, Divi’s Labs, Hindalco Industries, Bajaj Finance, Eicher Motors and NPTC were among the stocks where mutual funds trimmed their stakes in excess of 5 per cent.

""In March, there was a record outflow from FPIs and record buying by domestic institutional investors. If I have to choose a time to invest, I would always choose March over November. If my investors are booking profit, so be it. At lower levels, I will be a buyer rather than a seller. Having said that, November, like October and September, saw profit booking by our clients. We have seen redemptions by people who were in financial need,” said Nilesh Shah of Kotak AMC.

Shah said it is not that fund managers are selling because they find the market expensive. Rather, it’s because investors are redeeming. “Our cash levels remained virtually stagnant over the last eight-nine months,"" he said. 

Redemptions by MF investors rose 26.7 per cent month-on-month (MoM) in November to Rs 28,100-odd crore while sales of equity schemes fell 18.4 per cent MoM to Rs 14,900 crore. This led to the highest ever net outflows of Rs 13,200 crore from mutual funds. 

AgenciesThe handful of stocks that saw buying by these funds during the month included Adani Ports, Dr Reddy's Labs, HCL Tech, Grasim, Maruti Suzuki, UPL, M&M, SBI, Sun Pharma and Coal India.

Mutual funds increased the number of shares they hold in Adani Ports by 7 per cent to 7.73 crore. Eighteen mutual funds owning less than 2 per cent stake in Adani Ports had Rs 3,180 crore worth of exposure in the Adani Group company.

In Dr Reddy's Labs, holdings of 20 mutual funds rose by 5.2 per cent MoM to 2.09 crore shares. In HCL Tech, MF holding rose by 4.8 per cent to 16.98 crore shares. Maruti Suzuki saw MF holding rise 4.3 per cent to 2.36 crore shares. In Grasim, they held 1.7 per cent more shares than in October. UPL saw over 1 per cent rise in the number of shares the MFs held in the company.

M&M, SBI, Sun Pharma and Coal India were some of the companies that saw MF buying during the month.

""Reasons of the selling could vary from risk-profiling to valuation concerns. There are multiple reasons why money is going out and it is natural that when money has been coming in for four-five months at a stretch, some amount of it will go out,"" Swarup Mohanty, CEO at Mirae Asset Global told ETNOW."

Outlook on Nifty 
The Nifty index has witnessed a sharp selloff during Wednesday’s trade. Long unwinding was seen ahead of the monthly expiry and the upcoming US elections. The index is currently trading in a distribution phase and has formed a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern on the daily chart. A break below its immediate support level of 11,650 could further accentuate the selling pressure and the index could reach our immediate target price of 11,500 during the upcoming week.

PowerGrid,"Nov 09, 2020, 05:26 PM IST",Day trading guide: Bank Nifty has more room on the upside,"Amit Trivedi, YES Securities

Rallying ~8 per cent in just six sessions, Nifty made a fresh all-time high at 12,474, surpassing Jan 2020 month’s peak of 12,431. Banking and financials were major contributors in the recent rally. Nifty in the previous week gained ~5 per cent. However, out of the Nifty50, only 14 stocks managed to beat the benchmark returns. It represents that selected stocks are leading from the front and others are gradually gaining traction. Appearance of another upward gapping action ensures an immediate floor near 11,200-11,250 zone.

Meanwhile, Bank Nifty retraced 66.66 per cent (i.e. 2/3) of the entire decline from record high. Post six days of rally, mild consolidation might be there. Nevertheless, Bank Nifty has more room on the upside. Hence, stock specific rally could continue.

India VIX index dropped in the recent past from 25 to levels of 20. Significant open interest additions are seen at ATM and OTM put strikes, while 11,500 call strike holds maximum base for this week's expiry. It suggests that traders are expecting Nifty to consolidate at the upper band.

Markets turned wobbly as Nifty’s another failed attempt to sustain above 12,000 almost erased this week’s gain. Nifty filled an upward gap which it formed on Monday. However, swift reversal from the gapping area suggests renewed buying interest during intraday decline. Decisive breakthrough above 12,000 is essential to gain substantial momentum on the upside, while on the flip side, levels of 11,800-11,750 are likely to act as an immediate floor.

Erasing early gains, Bank Nifty entered in negative territory. However, bulls’ regained control over momentum as Bank Nifty managed to sustain above Tuesday’s low. Sustenance above 24,000 is likely to keep near-term outlook positive. On the higher side, it could inch higher till 25,000.

Triumph India is hopeful of growing by 20-25 per cent in its current fiscal year, though it may see almost flat sales growth in calendar year 2020 on account of zero business in the first few months of the pandemic.

Triumph follows July-June fiscal year.

Triumph India has 16 motorcycles in its portfolio ranging from modern classics to adventure motorcycles, including the iconic Rocket 3R and the recently launched Rocket 3GT.

""We are planning to launch nine new models from January to June, which will include some special editions in our current product range. This will be for the first time that we will be adding special editions in our product portfolio here. And, of course, some of the current products will also go with the regular refresh,"" Shoeb Farooq, Business Head, Triumph Motorcycles India, told PTI in an interaction.

These motorcycle models include the Trident 660 and new Tiger 850 Sport, which will be adding volumes in the company's overall sales kitty, he said, adding that the company is going to address a completely new segment of the industry.

""So all this put together, we are going to have a very very busy six months from January onwards and somewhere in June we will have a completely new range and much larger portfolio to customers,"" he added.

The overall premium motorcycle segment has de-grown by around 35-38 per cent in the last 12 months, in line with the rest of industry, he said, adding that people generally tend to defer decisions on purchasing luxury products when the economy is under stress.

""But despite industry's de-growth, Triumph as a brand has done well. In the last 6-7 months, including the pandemic period, we have done almost the same volumes that we did last year. In fact, starting from July, the volumes have actually grown over by 12 per cent which is a big positive and beating the industry and growing our market share has really given us a very good start post the pandemic,"" he said.

Premium motorcycle space remains a very niche segment in the over all two-wheeler space, with the 500-cc and above segment clocking sale of around 20,000 units per annum, which is not large, but is growing very fast.

Triumph is looking at a decent growth of around 20-25 per cent in this financial year (July 2020-June 2021) and considering that volumes till November have grown at 12 per cent, the company should be able to achieve the outlook of 20-25 per cent growth for this fiscal, he said

""However, since we missed a couple of months in this calendar year, we should be more or less flat in this calendar year (2020),"" he added.

The availability of BS-VI models and their subsequent roll out from January-February onwards, not holding back even during the lockdown, as well as strong product proposition has helped Triumph in achieving this growth, he said.

""Today we have the most robust BS-VI-compliant range of 13 motorcycles, which is the largest BS-VI range in the competing industry, which has given us a huge head start and growth,"" Farooq added.

Besides launching the new sport tourer Street Triple RS in April, Triumph has also rolled out Street Triple R, the all-new Tiger 900 and RGT, the touring variant of Rocket 3R, so far this year.

""For the first time, this financial year we will be surpassing sale of 100 Rockets in a year,"" he said.

Triumph has flagship and leadership positions in some of the segments like adventure space within the premium category, and represents all genres of motorcycles from adventure to urban roadster to modern classics, he said.

The company's strategy is ""inside out"". It is focusing on what capability Triumph has and what product it can bring in the Indian market to drive its growth, Farooq said.

""We have kind of established ourself as a premium motorcycle manufacturer using the premium end of the industry. Also with the new 650 Triumph platform, we are looking at a new segment and hence additional volume growth for the brand.

""And then in the long-term also our strategy is very clear, how we want to proceed in India with our tie up with Bajaj Auto where a completely new set of products have (been) planned through that partnership which will then start addressing a new industry, new set of customers and a much larger set of customers in India,"" he said.

Triumph has a very clear roadmap for India. The company is very clear that India is an important market for the brand and has its long-term strategy in place, Farooq added."

Bajaj Auto and PMAG hold approximately 48 per cent and 51.7 per cent, respectively, in KTM AG Austria. Bajaj’s shareholding is through its fully-owned Netherlands-based subsidiary Bajaj Auto International Holdings BV. 

PMAG is listed on the Vienna, Zurich and Frankfurt exchanges. Pierer Industrie, the parent of PMAG, holds over 60 per cent in the company while the balance is free float.

The proposal envisages Bajaj swapping its 48 per cent stake in KTM AG for a stake in PMAG and both Pierer Industrie and Bajaj then moving their stakes in PMAG to a new holding company.

Bajaj Auto,"Nov 30, 2020, 06:11 PM IST",Motown diaries: Stellar growth in tractor sales to boost November auto volumes,"NEW DELHI: A superb growth in tractor sales and strong demand for other vehicles, especially from rural India, will keep the auto sales numbers in the green as automakers start reporting data from Tuesday onwards. 

Auto sales have been improving for a few months now, especially riding on sustained demand from rural markets and festive sales. This is also seen in shares of auto companies, which have been on an upward trajectory.

“The automobiles industry is expected to continue to be on a roll in November with strong sales volumes driven by robust tractor sales, followed by passenger vehicles and two-wheeler sales,” Sharekhan said in a report.

The broker expects two-wheelers to register 20 per cent YoY growth led by Hero Moto and Bajaj Auto. The sales will be driven by higher offtake from semi-urban, tier-II and tier-III cities, it said. Passenger vehicle segment is expected to clock a 13.9 per cent YoY growth led by Maruti Suzuki and M&M, Sharekhan said.

Analysts say they have noticed a slowdown in the pace of wholesale volume growth month-on-month, but is likely to sustain growth in November, led by the festive season falling in the month of November versus October.


ETMarkets.com
“In terms of retail volumes, our checks indicate that cumulatively (Oct+Nov), passenger vehicles retails are up in single digits, while two-wheelers have declined in double digits YoY. Passenger vehicles sales have also been impacted by lower inventory days (<15 ), which should catch up over the coming months,” said Kapil Singh, an analyst at Nomura India.

“Rural demand remains strong and there is no slowdown. We have been highlighting that while rural demand has strong economic drivers, urban demand lacks those. As such, volumes of market leaders in rural segments, such as Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki and Hero Motocorp, are likely to outperform industry volumes in November in their respective segments,” Singh added.

Tractor sales, which he the analyst sees at 50 per cent, he added that if the momentum sustains, he sees upside risk to our estimate of 10 per cent YoY industry volume growth in FY21, compared to a decline for all other auto segments.

“We expect tractor sales to surge by 83 per cent YoY driven by higher farm incomes, robust Kharif sowing, a good monsoon and benefits of a low base of the previous year. Retail tractor retail sales grew by 55.5 per cent YoY in October, which explains the massive rise in demand,” Sharekhan said."

Two major events -- short covering ahead of November 2020 F&O expiry and rebalancing of MSCI portfolios -- helped the Indian market to recover sharply from lower levels. The Nifty50 index regained 13,000 levels and is now exhibiting remarkable strength. The unusual support from commodities and financials always helps the market move forward. Technically, for the next two days, 13,070 and 13,150 levels would be major hurdles for the index. If the Nifty50 index crosses 13,150, it could jump to 13,350 levels. However, below 12,930, the index would invite worries in the near term.

Nifty took a breather after rallying for the last 14 days and fell 1.39 per cent. The index has now formed the formation of an ""inverted hammer"", suggesting profit booking by investors in the market. Based on that, the Nifty would correct and may fall in the near future. However, the Nifty needs to trade below the 12,800 levels. Activity above the level of 12,850 and elimination of the level of 12,970 levels would lead to an immediate march on the level of 13,100/13,200. Closing below the level of 12,780 has opened the door for Nifty to fall to 12,500/12,450 levels.

This purchase is also among the costliest transactions based on the per sq ft rate of Rs 1.22 lakh paid by the billionaire nephew of Bajaj Auto patriarch Rahul Bajaj. The 3,185-sq ft apartment is on the 7th floor of under-construction project Carmichael Residences spread over half an acre. Jain had earlier paid Rs 1.57 lakh per sq ft for two apartments on the 19th floor.

The super-premium tower is coming up on Altamount Road-Carmichael Road, known for housing billionaires including Mukesh Ambani and Kumar Mangalam Birla.

Jain has paid stamp duty of Rs 78 lakhs for the deal registered earlier this week, showed the registration documents reviewed by ET. He will also get a total of four car parks as per the terms of the agreement.

Ranked 84th on the Forbes India rich list in 2019, Jain is one of Rahul Bajaj’s twin nephews. They operate their non-competing auto components businesses Endurance Technologies and Varroc Engineering out of Aurangabad.

Endurance, which has a market capitalisation of over Rs 12,500 crore, supplies parts for two-wheelers and three-wheelers in India and car components in Europe. The promoters including Jain and his family own 75% of the company.

The 22-storey luxury residential tower, where Jain has bought these three apartments for a total Rs 139 crore, is being developed by RA Realty Ventures, formed by the Khemchand B Kothari Group and Ashok Piramal Group’s realty development company Peninsula Land.

Calls and text messages to buyer Jain remained unanswered. Vivek Kothari, director of KBK Group, the joint developer of the project, declined to comment for the story.

The Maharashtra government has reduced stamp duty from 5% to 2% up to December end and 3% between January and March in a bid to encourage home sales.

The company, which exports to around 79 countries globally, reported its best ever dispatches to international markets last month. 

 ""In terms of recovery, international business is doing better than domestic because most of the countries where we export have not been impacted that much by the pandemic and lockdowns as India,"" Bajaj Auto CFO Soumen Ray told in an interview. 

 The demand is very robust and various markets like Africa, Latin America Middle East and South Asia are doing very well, he added. 

 ""We have only two areas of concern, one is ASEAN region where major markets like the Philippines and Cambodia are witnessing lockdowns and restrictions. Other is Sri Lanka, where the government has banned import of vehicles,"" Ray said. 

 Barring these two, the company is witnessing very strong revival, he added. 

 ""It (revival in export markets) is borne out of two factors -- severity of pandemic has been less in these regions and thus, the economy is also less impacted,"" Ray said. 

 The company's export order book is very strong for the next few months, he said. 

 Bajaj Auto shipped 2.12 lakh units in September to various international markets. 

 In July-September period, however, two-wheeler dispatches fell 11 per cent to 4,14,271 units as compared with 4,62,890 units in the same period of previous fiscal. 

 Commenting on the outlook for domestic market, Ray said the company is witnessing increase in footfalls and inquiries at the dealerships. 

 ""Jury is still out regarding the festive season this year. Looking at the response in the first few days of the festive season, our sense is that it is going to be similar or marginally better than last year,"" he noted. 

 On three-wheeler sales, Ray said the revival in the segment depends on pick up in economic activity involving small commercial vehicles. 

 ""Certain economic activity is required for demand to come back. Economic activity here pertains to movement of people from one place to another, relatively short distances, in both urban and rural landscapes,"" he noted. 

 ""Till that doesn't happen, like opening of schools, entertainment areas, why would anybody like to buy a commercial two-wheeler or a three-wheeler,"" he added. 

 He, however, said that situation is improving in the three-wheeler segment and September quarter was much better than first quarter of the current fiscal. MSS RVK"

Investment managers led by Prashant Jain at the country’s second-largest money manager increased exposure to Coal India, whose shares are down 1.30 per cent since the beginning of this financial year. It bought nearly 80 lakh shares in the world’s single largest coal producer last month.

The fund house also picked over 40 lakh shares each in REC and ITC. Shares of the former have gained 53 per cent to Rs 136 as of December 11 from Rs 88 on March 31, while those of the latter have risen nearly 26 per cent to Rs 216. The 30-share Sensex has added 56.40 per cent during the same period.

Global brokerage Jefferies is bullish on ITC with a price target of Rs 265. “Given the Covid-related concerns, we find consumer staple firms relatively better placed given the defensive nature of the business. Businesses with strong cash flows and robust balance sheets may be preferred during this period of disruption,” it said.

The fund house further raised its holdings in outperformers such as Sun Pharmaceuticals, GAIL (India), The Federal Bank, Jamna Auto, Hindalco, Vedanta, Lupin, HCL Technologies, Rain Industries and HAL, among others. Shares of these companies have gained 55-155 per cent since April 1.

Meanwhile, the fund house sold more than 1 crore shares each in ICICI Bank, Ambuja Cement, Tata Steel, PNB and Power Grid and offloaded more than 50 lakh shares each in BPCL, NHPC, NTPC and SBI.

Sectorwise, the fund house bought additional 1 lakh shares of Bank of Baroda and IDFC First Bank from the banking space. In auto, it picked more than 13,000 shares of Bajaj Auto, 60,000 shares of Maruti Suzuki and 2.46 lakh shares of Mahindra & Mahindra.

Of late, realty stocks have been on the radar of investors and analysts. “While demand is recovering in some pockets on a low base, we believe absorption and supply at the industry level will remain subdued and cash flow issues will worsen,” Edelweiss Securities said in a report.

It said developers with strong brand reputations and low leverage are best placed to survive the turmoil.

Overall, HDFC AMC raised exposure to at least 76 stocks during the month, but cut it in 92 others, data available with Ace Mutual Fund showed. Some of this buying or selling may have been done for the AMC’s passively-managed index funds.

In the broader market, the fund house completely exited Bata India, Colgate-Palmolive, Nalco, Nila Infra and VIP Industries. Its fresh buys during the month included Ashok Leyland, Dabur India, Mindspace Business Park REIT, Sun TV Network, The Ramco Cement and Torrent Power.

Ambit Capital is positive on Ashok Leyland with a price target of Rs 128. “Among the commercial vehicles (CV) OEMs, we prefer Ashok Leyland to Tata Motors, as the former is a pure-play domestic CV maker with a cleaner balance sheet, lower capex needs and facing limited competitive intensity. Though Ashok Leyland has moved up about 80 per cent in last six months, we believe it is just the initial rally for a four-year extended upcycle after around 70 per cent decline during FY20-21E,” Ambit said. It also has ‘buy’ ratings on Maruti Suzuki with a price target of Rs 8,677."
Coal India Ltd,"Dec 14, 2020, 04:52 PM IST",Coal PSUs to adopt alternate transport methods to replace road transport in large mines: Pralhad Joshi,"New Delhi: Coal and Mines Minister Pralhad Joshi on Monday said public sector coal companies, including state-owned Coal India, will adopt alternate transport methods, including mechanised conveyor systems, computerised loading onto railway rakes, among others, for movement of coal in large mines, replacing road transport. 

 The minister, who chaired a meeting of the Consultative Committee on Coal & Mines Ministries on First Mile Connectivity projects, said first mile connectivity will promote ease of living in coal mine areas by reducing traffic congestion, road accidents and adverse impact on environment. 

 ""Coal PSUs will adopt alternate transport methods like mechanized conveyor systems, computerized loading onto railway rakes etc. replacing road transport in large mines,"" the minister said in a tweet. 

 Coal India Ltd (CIL), which accounts for over 80 per cent of domestic coal output, had earlier said that it has identified 14 additional projects involving capital expenditure of more than Rs 3,400 crore under the 'first-mile connectivity' initiative to upgrade transport facility at mines. 

 The state-run miner is replacing road transport of coal from pitheads to despatch points with mechanised systems like conveyor belts to decrease transportation time. It had announced 35 projects under the first phase of the initiative, of which two are operational. 

 ""Four coal companies of CIL (Coal India Ltd) together will infuse a tentative capital of over Rs 3,400 crore in these projects that have a total of 100.5 million tonnes/year capacity,"" the company had said. 

 Of the 14 projects in phase II, Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL) accounts for five projects with 62.5 million tonnes per annum capacity. 

 Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd with a solitary project has 20 million tonnes per annum capacity. Eastern Coalfields Ltd has seven projects and South Eastern Coalfields Ltd has one project with a capacity of 14 million tonnes per annum and 4 million tonnes per annum, respectively, the statement had said."

The upsurge in the booked or allocated quantity of coal was close to 30 MTs in absolute terms, compared to 38.6 MTs booked during the same period a year ago, a company official said.

Exclusive auction for non-power consumers booked 17.4 MTs which is 25.5% of the total allocated quantity during the period. Compared to 4.8 MTs booked by non-power consumers during April-November last year, the growth is 262%. E-auction sales for November 2020 witnessed improved volume bookings at 9.4 MTs, clocking 23.7% growth over last November, helping CIL net 30% premium over the notified prices.

The company earned a 13% premium through auctions in October 2020 when CIL.

‘Special spot auction for coal importers’ also gained positive response with 3.3 MTs booked in November’20 with a premium of 21%. The quantity is twice that of 1.6 MTs booked in October, the first occasion CIL introduced this window when the premium fetched over notified price was 14%.

“For now the focus remains on volume expansion in e-auction sales rather than add-ons over the reserve price. Going forward add-ons will be pliable based on subsidiary wise and grade wise demand,” the official said. The demand from the non-power sector is on the up and there is scope for further increase. Till the demand from the power, sector strengthens and stabilizes, CIL is eyeing sponge iron, captive power plants, cement and aluminium sectors.

However, given the power sector’s 80% share in CIL’s total off-take programme, it will not be feasible for the non-power sector to offset demand shortfall from the power sector fully. To ramp up volume despatches and substitute imported coal with domestic coal. CIL has communicated with over 300 coal importers seeking their requirement from domestic sources."

Coal India Ltd,"Dec 07, 2020, 07:02 AM IST",Why are HNIs making a beeline for CPSE ETF,"MUMBAI: Value is emerging from the shadow of growth – especially with the deep pocketed. That’s benefiting the CPSE ETF, which gained 13% in a fortnight.

What’s drawing the rich to a segment of the market that’s rather dull otherwise? There are several factors: Attractive PSU valuations, dividend yields that exceed bank deposit rates, tax arbitrage over direct equity and negligible expense ratio. Average volumes on the NSE have jumped to 14.7 million units in the past one week compared to an average of 3.3 million units in November.

With the market trading at an all-time high, wealth managers are looking for themes with a margin of safety – and are tax efficient, undervalued and help preserve capital.


The CPSE ETF has a dividend yield of 5.55%, PE of 10.68 and a PB of 1.09. By contrast, the Nifty 50 has a PE of 36.46, dividend yield of 1.2 and PB of 3.75.

“Undervaluation of stocks in the CPSE basket and high dividend yield make it an attractive bet,” said Rupesh Bhansali, head (distribution), GEPL Capital. He advised investors to take small bets.

The CPSE ETF is a passive investment scheme that was created to help the government to disinvest some of its stake in selected CPSEs. The government has so far offered units to investors in seven tranches since March 2014. The portfolio has 12 stocks, with four companies - Power Grid, NTPC, Coal India and ONGC – together making up 77% of the portfolio and has an expense ratio of less than 1 paisa. The ETF is down 14% in the last one year while over 3 years, it has lost an annualized 12%.

Analysts believe higher dividends from CPSEs, and the government decision to avoid frequent stake sales could lead to rerating of CPSE stocks. They believe these companies have profitable growth and many of them enjoy monopolies in their line of business.

JM Financial said in a report that even though CPSEs like NTPC and Coal India delivered profit growths of 8% and 3% in the period 2015-2021, their market capitalization eroded by 23% and 66%, largely led by ESG concerns and repeated government stake sales.

“Most stocks are trading at a steep discount to historic valuations as investors are not sure about the government’s direction. In the recent past, representatives from the government have been engaging with fund managers on ways to improve valuations,” said the CIO at a domestic fund house. 

Financial planners are also recommending ultra HNIs to take advantage of the high dividend yield and tax arbitrage through this product.

“From this financial year onwards dividend earned from shares is taxed in line with your tax slab, while if it is earned via the equity mutual fund route you pay only capital gains tax, which is far lower,” said Anup Bhaiya, MD and CEO, Money Honey Financial Services.

Given that the dividend yield of CPSE ETF is higher at 5.5% compared to bank fixed deposits that pay around 5%, and the tax advantage many HNIs are allocating a small portion of their fixed deposit portfolio to the CPSE ETF.

For example, dividends earned by a shareholder in a company will be taxed as per his tax bracket. So, ultra HNIs will pay 42% tax on dividends earned from equity. However, if the same was earned through a mutual fund, it will be added to the NAV and will reflect there. An investor holding such a mutual fund pays only long term tax of 10% if units are sold after a year, and 15% if within, thereby giving a tax arbitrage of up to 32%."

The supply by Coal India (CIL) to non-power sectors was up by a robust 46 per cent during the month, the PSU said in a statement. 

 ""CIL's off-take was 51.3 million tonnes (MTs) in November of the ongoing fiscal, an increase of 3.8 MT compared to 47.5 MTs of same month last year,"" it said. 

 Sectors other than power accounted for the entire increase. 

 Coal production at 51.7 MT in November clocked a growth of 3.3 per cent, with 1.7 MT uptick in absolute terms. 

 CIL had produced 50 MT of coal in November 2019. 

 With the non-power consumers showing a tendency to lift more coal, CIL's supply to this segment has risen to 12.3 MT in November, logging a growth of 46 per cent compared to 8.4 MT in November last fiscal. 

 Non-power sectors' lifting accounted for 24 per cent of the last month's total despatch. This segment predominantly consists of cement, sponge iron, captive power plants and a host of other industries. 

 The growth in supplies to the non-power sectors till November was 14 per cent at 80.6 MT. 

 ""We are reorienting our marketing plans. With the demand from power sector yet to boom fully we are concentrating our efforts on non-power consumers to expand our sales volume. Till there is demand resurgence from power sector, we shall follow this, which is helping us,"" a senior executive of the company said. 

 The PSU further said 83 power plants have regulated lifting of coal in November. Of this, 26 have considerably reduced their programme placed for rakes against their entitlement. The remaining 57 have not filed their programme for rakes, which led to demand stagnation during the month. 

 The power sector of the country is stocked with 37.4 MT of coal at their end, sufficient for 22 days. With CIL riding high on 53.5 MT pithead stock a combined stock of 91 MT is available in the system, sufficient to meet any demand surge. 

 After a spurt of 14 per cent in October, supply to power sector has come down to a flat growth in November at 39.1 MT due to weakened demand. 

 Average loading per day to non-power sector during the month marked a steep 59 per cent growth at 40 rakes per day against 25 rakes same month last year. 

 Total rake loading went up by 20 per cent as CIL loaded 264 rakes per day last month against 220 rakes in November 2019."

Coal India Ltd,"Nov 28, 2020, 11:31 AM IST","View: With rapid shut down of coal mines, energy transition and just transition must go togather","The writing is on the wall. A few days back, Coal India Limited (CIL), the world’s biggest coal producer and India’s largest CO2 emitter, announced its plans to become a ‘net-zero energy company’ by 2023-24. The company plans to install 3,000 MW of solar power to meet all its electricity demand, which will also reduce its power expenses. The foray into solar is part of CIL’s diversification plans to shift from a coal company to an energy company.

NTPC Limited, India’s largest coal-based power company, has won a bid this week to install 470 MW solar power at Rs 2.01/kWh. This tariff is 40% below the cost of existing coal power in India and less than half the price of new coal-fired power. NTPC has set up a separate renewable energy subsidiary – NTPC Renewable Energy – to build its green energy portfolio.

When the biggest coal mining and coal power companies see their future in renewable energy, it is time for the policy makers to start planning for coal phase-down and Just Transition of coal mining districts.


""The situation is changing rapidly, and coal mines are being shut down in an unplanned fashion due to various factors, including unprofitability.""— No Phase-out Plan
Just Transition was included in the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015 to ensure that the workers and communities dependent on fossil fuels like coal do not suffer due to the closing of mines and power plants to meet the climate change goals. India has so far not engaged nationally or internationally on coal phase-out and Just Transition because of the country’s high dependence on coal for energy security and industrial growth. But the situation is changing rapidly, and coal mines are being shut down in an unplanned fashion due to various factors, including unprofitability.

In Jharkhand, 50% of mines are closed, and half of the operational mines are unprofitable. Most of the mines have been shut down without proper mine closure and plans for the mining areas’ socio-economic transition. The situation at the district level is even more ominous. In Bokaro, 16 of the 25 mines are already closed, and six of the nine operational mines will exhaust their reserves in the next 10 years. In Jamtara (made famous by the Netflix series of the same name), all five mines are closed. In Ramgarh, a top coal-producing district, 50% of mines are shut, and two-thirds of the operational mines are unprofitable. The situation becomes alarming when one considers the economic dependence of these districts on coal.


""In Jharkhand, 50% of mines are closed; In Bokaro, 16 of the 25 mines are closed; In Jamtara, all five mines are closed""— Rapid Scale Down
Take the case of Ramgarh. Coal mining and coal-dependent industries contribute about 40% of the district’s GDP. Furthermore, one-fourth of the households depend directly on the coal industry for income, mostly informal workers. Therefore, the unplanned closing of mines has real implications on the lives and livelihoods of workers and local communities. The irony is these districts suffered ‘resource curse’ and environmental degradation due to coal mining and are now suffering economically because of its unplanned closure.

But this need not be the case. Experiences worldwide show that Just Transition can be a win-win for the environment and the economy if planned and managed well. A similar effort can be made in India to close coal mines over the next two-three decades and transition coal-dependent districts to a non-coal economy. The good news is that opportunities exist for such a transition planning to start immediately.


""70% of CIL’s mines are loss-making. It can close these and use the additional profits to implement Just Transition in mining areas.""— A Way Out
About 70% of CIL’s mines are loss-making. Many of these mines are losing more than Rs 1,000 per tonne of coal production (coal price in India is about Rs 3,000 per tonne). These mines (more than 170 in numbers) produce less than 10% of coal, employ about 40-45% of CIL’s workforce and incur an aggregate loss of Rs 16,000 crore per year – about the same as the annual profits of the company. CIL can close these unprofitable mines and use the additional profits to implement Just Transition in these mining areas. Coal cess, which collects about Rs 38,000 crore per year and is used for GST compensation till 2022, can also be used for the socio-economic transition of these mining areas.

All the above can only happen if we accept the inevitability of coal phase-out and put in place a Just Transition policy and planning framework. Just Transition is imperative for India. If we do not start planning for a post-coal future now, our coal-dependent regions and industries will face major disruptions in the coming years.

Coal India Ltd,"Nov 20, 2020, 12:11 PM IST",9 Nifty stocks 100-340% down from peak prices: Should you buy?,"NEW DELHI: Equity benchmark Nifty might have made an all-time high at 12,948 this week, but hitting such record levels seems like a distant dream for nine index stocks, which need to gain 100-338 per cent to revisit their previous peaks.

Many of these stocks are on analysts’ ‘buy’ list, though none of them promises to make fresh highs for now, if one were go by analyst targets.


ONGC: This stock settled at Rs 71.90 on Wednesday and needs a 338 per cent rally to revisit its all-time high of Rs 314 hit on June 9, 2014. BoB Capital Markets said the stock’s underperformance despite the recent rise in oil prices provides valuation comfort, especially amid the decline in operating costs.

“As oil prices remain strong, we find the risk-reward favourable and upgrade the earnings estimates. As cash flows improve amid a decline in leverage, we see a strong probability of either higher dividend payout or share buyback going forward,” the brokerage said. It suggested a price target of Rs 104 on the stock. Edelweiss has a price target of Rs 100. Motilal Oswal Securities sees the stock at Rs 90 while IDBI Capital has a target of Rs 85.


Coal India: Coal India requires a 270 per cent rally to hit the August 2015 high of Rs 447. This stock is a ‘buy’ for Emkay Global, but with a lower target price of Rs 180 against Rs 208 earlier amid concerns over low e-auction premiums.

Taking cognisance of lower cash accretion, Edelweiss has cut its price target for Coal India to Rs 155 from Rs 165.
The stock closed at Rs 120.75 on Wednesday. “Realisations from e-auction and volume growth have been under pressure on account of a decline in power demand and significant stocks at both mines and power plants. However, power demand has shown signs of improvement, and we expect volumes to recover in 2HFY21,” Motilal Oswal said and recommended a price target of Rs 192 on the stock.


Tata Motors: The stock needs a 249 per cent rise over its Wednesday’s price to revisit the February 2015 high of Rs 605 apiece. HDFC Securities last week upgraded the stock to ‘Buy’ rating from ‘Add’, as it expects the OEM to benefit from improving demand outlook, cost-cutting initiatives and better FCF generation. “JLR’s retail volumes are improving from Covid lows, and system inventories are normalising,” it said and recommended a price target of Rs 175 on the stock. Phillip Capital said the company has turned the corner and the worst is behind it. This brokerage has a price target of Rs 167 on the stock. The stock traded at Rs 173 on Wednesday, suggesting muted upside potential. 


NTPC: NTPC needs a 174 per cent gain to reach its March January 2008 high. Analysts have a ‘strong buy’ recommendation on the stock. In a recent note, IIFL said NTPC valuations are very undemanding at 0.7 times FY21E PBV and it comes with an attractive dividend yield of 6.4 per cent. “The regulated RoE of 15.5 per cent till FY24E and commercialisation of capacities provide good earnings visibility and will lend support to the stock price,” it said. Kotak Securities finds the fair value of the stock at Rs 125. The stock closed at Rs 88.30 on Wednesday.


IndianOil: IOC requires a 172 per cent jump to hit the August 2017 high. JP Morgan has March 2021 price target of Rs 140 on the stock, while UBS’s 12-month target stands at Rs 130 and Prabhudas Lilladher’s at Rs 118. IOC hit a record high of Rs 231.47 on August 31 2017, as per corporate database AceEquity.

Nirmal Bang’s buy call on IOC is based on improved outlook for retail margins, a likely recovery in refining and petchem margins in next 1-2 years due to likely closure of capacities and compelling valuation after a sharp 45 per cent drop in the stock price in last one year, which has priced in worries over margins and the likely risk of rising competition from private retailers/alternative fuels.


IndusInd Bank: At Rs 828, shares of IndusInd Bank are trading higher than JM Financial’s price target for the stock at Rs 750, Nomura’s target of Rs 725 and Edelweiss’ target of Rs 665. Up 125 per cent in the last six months, this stock is still down 45 per cent year to date. Edelweiss said concerns over asset quality will dominate IndusInd’s core business momentum gains in the foreseeable future. “Demonstration of the merger value-add and getting through the current crisis without earnings erosion thereof are key,” it said.


Sun Pharma: ICICI Securities has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 610. Prabhudas Lilladher sees the stock at Rs 597, JPMorgan at Rs 600, JM Financial at Rs 770 and Macquarie at Rs 620. The stock has 32 ‘buy’, 2 ‘hold’ and 5 ‘sell’ ratings. 

Emkay Global said while the company management has indicated that the reduction in sales and promotional expenses is not structural, it expects the Ebitda margin to remain at around 25 per cent in the near term, as other expenses are likely to moderate in third and possibly fourth quarters. This brokerage has a price target of Rs 560 on the stock. Specialty sales growth, Halol plant resolution and recovery in the branded markets are seen as key driver for the Sun Pharma stock, analysts said.


GAIL: Prabhudas Lilladher expects GAIL’s capex trajectory to pick up as all businesses (excluding pipeline) operate at near-peak levels. A weak commodity price outlook amid uncertain demand recovery remains a key risk, it said and suggested a price target of Rs 108 on the stock. IDBI Capital has a price target of Rs 109 on the stock while JM Financial sees it at Rs 125.

“Given the weakness in share price, the prevailing market price is implying zero value for its gas trading and petchem/LPG businesses due to low earnings visibility. “Hence, we maintain a buy rating as the valuation provides a margin of safety,” JM Financial said.


ITC: Antique, IIFL, Elara, Jefferies, Kotak Institutional Equities and CLSA, among others, have ‘buy’ ratings on the stock with price targets ranging from Rs 235 to Rs 273. At 14.5 times FY22 earnings, the stock valuation appears to be compelling while a higher payout implies an attractive 5 per cent dividend yield, Jefferies said and maintained a price target of Rs 265 on the stock.

Geojit expects an improvement across ITC’s verticals in the months ahead. “However, the pace of pickup in volumes and demand remains crucial,” it said as it valued the stock at Rs 217."
Coal India Ltd,"Nov 19, 2020, 06:02 PM IST","F&O: Nifty risks further fall if it fails to hold above 12,750-12,800 zone","By Chandan Taparia 

Nifty on Thursday opened negative in line with weak global cues, but witnessed a smart recovery from lower levels in the initial hour of the session. Later, the index recovered its intraday losses and extended its gains to hit a new record life time high of 12,963. However, in the latter part of the session, it failed to hold at higher levels and drifted sharply towards 12,750 level.

The index formed a Bearish Candle on the daily scale and negated the formation of higher lows after three sessions. It remained highly volatile as it traded in a wide range of 200 points. Now it has to hold above the 12,750 – 12,800 zone to witness a bounce towards 12,900 and 13,000 levels, while a hold below the same level could trigger weakness and drive Nifty towards 12,700 and 12,650 levels.

India VIX moved up 2.35% from 19.12 to 19.57 levels. Volatility has cooled down, but needs to remain at lower levels to ride the momentum with higher market base.

On the options front, maximum Put open interest stood at 12,000 level followed by 12,500 while maximum Call OI was at 13,000 followed by 13,500 levels. Marginal Call writing was seen at strike prices 12,900 and 13,500 while there was Put writing at 12,000 and 12,600 levels. Options data suggested a wider trading range between 12,500 and 13,000 levels.

Bank Nifty opened gap down, but recovered its intraday losses to extend its move towards 29,600 mark. However, it failed to hold at higher levels and witnessed selling pressure in the latter part of the session. It corrected more than 800 points from higher levels and formed a bearish candle on daily scale. It also negated the formation of higher highs and lows after three sessions. Now it needs to hold above 29,000 level to witness a bounce towards 29,250 and then 29,500 levels while a hold below the same level could trigger weakness towards 28,750 then 28,500 levels.

Nifty futures closed negative at 12,778 level with a loss of 1.38%. The trade setup looked positive in ITC, Power Grid, NTPC, Coforge, Bata India and Jindal Steel but weak in ICICI Bank, SBIN, Axis Bank, Coal India, Jubilant Food, Marico, JSW Steel and HDFC Life.

Coal India Ltd,"Nov 16, 2020, 04:21 PM IST",CIL floats tenders for 35 mining projects identified for mechanised coal transportation,"New Delhi: State-owned Coal India Ltd (CIL) on Monday said it has issued tenders for all 35 mining projects identified for mechanised transportation of dry fuel and setting up coal handling plants and silos for rapid loading at an estimated cost of Rs 12,500 crore. Under mechanised transportation, coal would be moved through piped conveyor belt mode promoting cleaner environment. With reduced movement of coal-laden trucks on roads, it brings down dust pollution to the comfort of people residing in the proximity of the mines. 

 ""Coal India's pitch for efficient and environment friendly mechanised coal transportation in its first-mile connectivity, replacing the road movement, gained pace with the company successfully issuing tenders for all the 35 projects, of phase-1, by September 2020 as planned,"" the PSU said in a statement. 

 First-mile connectivity refers to transportation of coal from CIL's pitheads to despatch points. 

 Coal handling plants (CHPs) and silos for rapid loading system would be commissioned across six of CIL's subsidiaries, under the tenders. 

 To come up by FY2024 at an estimated investment of Rs 12,500 crore, the coal handling capacity of the 35 projects will be 406 million tonnes per year. 

 Each of these mining projects has production capacity of four million tonnes per year and above. 

 CIL is undertaking a study through National Environmental Engineering Institute (NEERI), Kolkata particularly for assessing and quantifying benefits of environmental aspects of these projects. 

 CHPs and silos will have benefits like crushing and sizing of coal and speedy computerised loading. Another upside is that with the reduced manual intervention, precise pre-weighed quantity of coal can be loaded. It also spurs loading of better quality coal. 

 ""Improved loading time will bring down the wagon idling thus increasing their availability. Easing the load on road networks induces savings on diesel as well apart from positive environmental considerations. It will be an all-round win-win situation for the company, railways, consumers and villagers in the proximity of the mines,"" a senior executive of the company said. 

 Currently, CIL spends around Rs 3,400 crore on coal transportation costs which could be brought down substantially with the introduction of mechanised coal transport in the first mile. 

 CIL also expects more than 12 per cent internal rate of return once it switches over to the mechanised transport means. 

 Already, mechanised conveyor system and computerised loading is operational in 19 projects of CIL having 151 million tonnes per year capacity. 

 With the commissioning of the 35 projects, it would be spiked up by an additional 406 MTs, making it a total of 557 million tonnes per year by 2023-24 giving fillip to CIL's efforts in quality and quantity loading."

“As India is a domestically oriented economy, we expect the coming year to be favourable for pro-cyclical sectors such as banks and consumer durables and for companies tied to a robust pickup in construction activity – cement, real estate, metals and road builders. With inflationary pressures largely contained, we expect rupee to have a strengthening bias and act as a headwind against export oriented sectors like IT services,’’ said S Hariharan of Emkay Global Financial Services.

BPCL investors were among the happiest lot, as the stock climbed 5.19 per cent to Rs 414.45, emerging as the biggest gainer among Nifty constituents. Indian Oil, Tata Motors, HDFC Life Insurance, Sun Pharma and Coal India were other major gainers, rising 1-3 per cent.

The Samvat year gone by remained highly volatility for equity investors. Dalal Street saw the indices rise till January 2020, before they saw a sharp drop due to panic selling on Covid breakout. Robust liquidity and better-than-expected Q2 earnings eventually helped the indices come back to their all-time high levels.

Analysts say the momentum is likely to stay strong for domestic equities in Samvat 2077.

“The 14,000 level looks achievable for Nifty by next Diwali, while Sensex should be around 47,000,” says Narendra Solanki, Head of Equity Research (Fundamental), Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.

In the largecap space, HDFC Securities is positive on Infosys, ICICI Bank and Bharti Airtel with price targets of Rs 1,205, Rs 503 and Rs 597, respectively.

Energy-to-telecom major Reliance Industries (RIL) has risen 41 per cent during the year, while Bharti Airtel added 28 per cent.

Solanki is positive on Bharti Airtel with a price target of Rs 625. “Bharti Airtel is poised for decent Arpu (average revenue per user) growth in India mobile business, though there might be some short-term impact on 4G subscriber additions.

Nirav Sheth, Chief Executive Officer, Emkay Institutional Equities, likes SBI from the PSU space. “Buying PSUs has been unfashionable and that has opened a huge valuation gap. SBI’s second quarter earnings has surpassed expectations with Covid-related impact on stress book largely contained. The bank should see meaningful recoveries as the NCLT process resumes.
