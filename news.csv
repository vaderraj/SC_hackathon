ICICI Bank,08 Dec 2020,Axis Securities picks 15 stocks that can return up to 46% by December 2021,"The market had a strong run for the second consecutive month in November, with the benchmark indices rising more than 11 percent and carrying the uptrend, so far, into December as well.The Sensex surpassed the 45,000-mark and the Nifty50 hit a record high of 13,250 on December 4, backed by consistent foreign liquidity, rising hopes of the economy turning positive in the second half of FY21  likely earnings growth, falling COVID-19 infections and more coronavirus vaccine candidates showing promise.The benchmark indices have rallied 72 percent from March 23's closing low. There have been shifts in the drivers of this rally. IT and pharma stocks were leaders till August, then after the September correction, banking and financials, infrastructure and metals have assumed the led roll.""Rally was seen across the financial services sector including the PSU banks, which have lagged significantly. As our allocation in the BFSI space has increased significantly, we will continue to maintain our allocation in the sector even after the solid rally,"" said Axis Securities that raised its earnings estimates after a strong beat in the September quarter.In Nifty50, 34 companies beat earnings expectations in Q2 by a reasonable margin. While a significant portion of the beat has been on account of better margins attributable to cost management but recovery of revenues has also been better than expected.With the significant beat as a backdrop, ""we have raised earnings estimates for FY21 and FY22 by 6 percent and 8 percent and introduced FY23 earnings. We arrive at December 2021 target by valuing the Nifty at 20x FY23E earnings of 730 translating to target of 14,600"", said the brokerage.The Nifty financial services index registered a 23 percent gain. The NSE private bank and the PSU bank indices were up by 24 percent each in November.""The key reason for the rally is that the market now believes that the orientation of the sector has changed from capital-protection to growth, while the challenges of NPA may not be as severe as they were believed to be at the beginning of Q2FY21. The management commentary across the board was largely upbeat,"" Axis Securities said.The broader markets also joined the party in November, as the Nifty midcap index surged 15.5 percent and smallcap index up 13 percent, taking gains from March lows to 83 percent and 98 percent, respectively, outperforming the Nifty.The majority of experts say the rally is expected to continue in broader space, as both midcap and smallcap indices lag the record highs they touched in January 2018.""Smallcaps and midcaps present with both better value and growth proposition over the medium term. We continue to remain bullish on the mid and small-cap theme and recommend more allocation in the space,"" Axis Securities said.Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have poured in Rs 1.74 lakh crore, so far, in the current financial year, partially due to recovery in the Indian economy with strong earnings and falling COVID cases as the US and several European countries are hit by a second wave.Indian economy reported a contraction of 7.5 percent in the September quarter 2020, much better than 24 percent decline in the previous quarter. The Reserve Bank of India expects the economy to turn positive in the second half of FY21 with a 0.1 percent growth in Q3FY21 and 0.7 percent in Q4FY21.""Economic indicators have improved with GDP for Q2FY21 was better than expectations. However, the impact of pent up demand has also started to recede and sustenance of demand across the sectors could pose challenges,"" Axis Securities said.""While there are challenges, the opportunities in the market are also significant. There is still value in BFSI, IT, telecom, small and mid-cap stocks. Our top picks orientation will continue towards adding beta and market dips should be viewed as a buying opportunity,"" the brokerage added.Axis has come out with a list of 15 stock picks which can return up to 46 percent by December 2021:ICICI BankWe maintain a positive view on ICICI Bank and believe that the bank offers the best risk-reward among bank coverage, given a healthy, sustainable earnings outlook. Asset quality is likely to strengthen following adequate provisioning and guidance of lower credit costs. A strong liability profile, better asset mix, and a healthy CAR could make ICICI well-positioned to come through this challenging period with a relatively lower degree of stress.Manappuram FinanceWe believe that credit costs will remain high on asset quality concerns for the non-gold business. We expect cost optimisation to aid profitability. Balance-sheet liquidity remains comfortable with no funding challenges. While cautious on the non-gold business, we believe the gold business will support overall performance in uncertain macro conditions. We expect MGFL to maintain ROAE of around 24 percent over FY21/FY22.Can Fin HomesWhile loan growth moderation is expected along-with slight asset quality deterioration on account of COVID-19, we expect the company to recover faster than its peers due to its loan mix and negligible developer exposure. Lower cost of funds should aid the company in maintaining NIMs, while the loan mix profile skewed towards the salaried segment will help in maintaining asset quality. We remain positive on the stock, given its loan book profile, stable liquidity position and robust CAR (25 percent).Federal BankGiven strong underwriting standards, changing loan mix and a strong retail deposit franchise, we expect the valuation to improve. Federal Bank adopted a cautious approach in building the loan mix toward high-rated corporates and retail loans. The bank's liability franchise remains strong with CASA plus Retail TD of around 90 percent and one of the highest LCR among banks.NOCILWe note there has been a significant improvement in the overall business from H2FY21 (aided by unlock driven improving demand in replacement tyres and OEMs) with a sharp rebound in volumes to be reported in FY22 on the back of new capacity commercialisation, economic growth bouncing back to normalcy and a low base. Further, a positive outcome on ADD levy and a structural opportunity to play as a dependable non-Chinese player augurs well for NOCIL's long term prospects.Varun BeveragesWith business growth restoring, aided by unlock as witnessed in Q3CY20, we expect this momentum to continue. The trend of in-home consumption has seen an increase and is likely to continue as consumers get habituated to consuming soft drinks at home. Further, OOH also resuming normalcy, there could be growth seen here too. Rural regions are likely to grow ahead of urban counterparts on the back of a healthy outlook for the Rabi crop. Share gain opportunities from smaller players are expected to boost its market share, especially in acquired territories of South and West where the company will look to add dealers ahead of the season in CY21.CCL ProductsWe believe CCLP is well placed to deliver steady earnings over the medium term given 1) expertise in customized blends and cost-efficient business model, 2) long-standing client relationships (around 50 percent revenue contribution from brand owners) 3) largest exporter of instant coffee in India 4) presence in Vietnam, the world’s largest Robusta growing country 5) capacity additions in value-added products (FDC & small packs) and 6) steadily improving branded retail business.Endurance TechnologiesWe expect Endurance Technologies to outperform the industry given its sticky relations with OEMs, broad product basket, market leadership with a market share of around 35 percent in suspensions, 25 percent in hydraulic-braking system, 20 percent in disc-braking system and 16 percent in transmission. New products along with tailwinds for 2-wheeler sector to support Endurance Technologies.Steel Strip WheelsBeing in an oligopoly market, SSWL commands leadership with the market share of around 55 percent in steel wheel rims and around 20 percent in alloy wheels. We expect SSWL to outperform the industry, given its sticky relations with OEMs across all the auto segment viz., 2/3W, PV, CV, and Tractors.Minda IndustriesWe are bullish on MNDA's ability to comprehensively beat industry performance by 1) leveraging the broader vehicular trends of industry like EV, premiumisation and automation 2) strategic inorganic acquisition to enhance product offering and gain market share 3) maintaining balance sheet discipline and maintain optimal leverage, 4) investing In R&D to bring technological change and 5) tap on its deep-rooted relationship with OEMs to increase kit value.Dr Reddy's LaboratoriesDRRD has leveraged its 100 ANDAs portfolio and launched high-value products with limited competition in the last two years. Further, commentary from Top 6 generic pharma players in NAG reveals pricing stability in the generic pharma business.  In the next two years, DRRD has a healthy pipeline to launch drugs like gRemodulin, gDexilant, gNuvaring, gCopaxone and gKuvan and potentially gVascepa that could be a gSuboxone kind opportunity. We expect revenue CAGR of 8.7 percent in constant currency for North America Generic business over FY20-FY23.BioconDriven by market share gains and new launches in these high-margin biosimilars, the biologics segment is expected to post robust revenue growth (approximately in mid-twenties) over the next two-three years. The management has set an ambitious target to cross $1 bn revenues for biologics over the next couple of years (from around $300 plus million in FY20). Biocon is targeting to have eight different biosimilars to be sold by FY22, thereby addressing a market size of $33 billion. The company is planning to deliver at least three additional molecules between FY23 and FY25.Tech MahindraWe believe Tech Mahindra has a resilient business structure from a long- term perspective. We recommend ""buy"" and assign 16x P/E multiple to its FY23 earnings estimates of Rs 62.7, which gives a target of Rs 975 per share.Bharti AirtelThe ARPU improvement in Q2FY21 was a function of customers upgrading and better post-paid sales. However, considering the industry structure further tariff hikes cannot be ruled out in the forthcoming quarters, which will lead to consistent EBIDTA improvement. Bharti's management indicated that ARPU will reach Rs 200 over the medium-term but the timing of tariff hikes is difficult to calibrate. We maintain ARPU assumptions and forecast 13 percent and 17 percent CAGR for revenue and EBIDTA, respectively, over the period FY20-23.HCL TechnologiesWe believe HCL has a resilient business structure from a long-term perspective. We recommend buy and assign 16.6x P/E multiple to its FY23 earnings estimates of Rs 58.8, which gives a target of Rs 975 per share."
ICICI Bank,07 Dec 2020,Buy ICICI Bank; target of Rs 600: Emkay Global Financial,"Emkay Global Financial's report on ICICI BankOur Digi-Banking Conference on November 26 emphasized that the Digital thrust is turbocharged due to Covid-19, while digitization and ‘fintegration’ are the way forward for incumbents. Over the years, ICICI has been evolving into a full-stack digital bank with endto-end digital solutions across businesses and is well-poised to ride the digital boom. ICICI Bank has made adequate investments in digital platforms, leading to virtually no outages - unlike its large peers that have recently faced regulatory ire - and better customer wallet share/profitability. The bank believes that its focus on balanced ‘Phygital strategy’ and customer life-cycle banking should lead to better revenues, cost savings - boosting core-profitability in the long run. Although the discussions were centered around digital initiatives, management reassured its long-standing risk-calibrated growth strategy, focus on customer-level profitability and better asset-quality experience in the current cycle with adequate provisioning buffers in place.OutlookWe believe that ICICI’s likely strong delivery on growth, asset quality and return ratios despite the Covid-induced disruption, coupled with its evolution as a strong retail-cumdigital bank, will call for a re-rating.

ICICI Bank,07 Dec 2020,Buy ICICI Bank; target of Rs 630 : Motilal Oswal,"Motilal Oswal's research report on ICICI BankWe attended ICICI Bank (ICICIBC)'s Analyst Day, wherein the bank highlighted the progress in its different businesses and how the bank is positioned to capitalize on the exciting opportunities in the space. The topics of discussion constituted (a) how the management is trying to build a strong bank with best-in-class digital capabilities, (b) using technology to accelerate growth across business verticals and maintaining healthy operating metrics, (c) focusing on identifying potential micro markets for expansion, (d) strong demand recovery in consumption loans, with disbursements in secured loans surpassing pre-COVID levels, and (e) how asset quality has remained resilient, with the bank maintaining one of the highest coverages among private banks. ICICI Bank has historically been a technology-savvy bank and has several innovations to its credit. However, systemic asset quality concerns have taken the center-stage and diverted investor focus away from the strong digital capabilities/innovations built by the bank. New digital innovations have positioned the bank well to gain incremental market share across key product lines. ICICIBC carries an additional provision buffer of 1.3% of loans, besides robust PCR. It has suggested in the past that corporate restructuring is likely to account for less than 100bp of loans.OutlookThe bank expects credit cost to normalize fully in FY22E, which would accelerate earnings growth. We estimate FY22/FY23 RoA at 1.5%/1.7%, enabling the bank to deliver FY23E RoE of 15.2%.

Based on presentations the bank continues to embrace on “One Bank One ROE” principle with retained focus on core operating profitability by either improving revenue lines or by reducing cost/improving efficiency via digital.

ICICI Bank,04 Dec 2020,Did Shaktikanta Das just distance himself from RBI panel’s recommendation on corporate houses' entry into banking?,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has not taken an official decision on an internal working group (IWG) report that recommended entry of corporate houses into banking, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said during the post-monetary policy presser on December 4.On November 20, the IWG suggested that business houses and large NBFCs (non-banking financial companies) can be given tickets to set up banks, triggering a major debate among experts on the impact of letting companies set up banks in the financial system.Das said the IWG proposal is not the RBI’s official view.“It is a report of the IWG, not the RBI’s official view. The IWG has two external members. It has acted independently. They have given an extra point of view. The RBI has not taken any decision. Our approach is consultative (on this issue). The report is in public domain. After comments, we will examine and take a considered decision,” Das said.Experts, including RBI's former governor governor Raghuram Rajan and former deputy governor Viral Acharya, came out openly in the public with strong criticism against the idea., while others, including former ICICI Bank CEO K V Kamath and Bandhan Bank CEO Chandra Shekhar Ghosh, supported the idea saying with enough regulations, corporate entry will be good for the sector.Das’ comments are significant. If one reads between the lines, Das has distanced itself from the controversial suggestions amid the public backlash. In an article for Mint , Kamath said India should consider opening up the banking sector, letting corporates join the sector under tight supervision.“Since India must broaden and deepen its financial system to achieve its national goals, we need to seriously consider letting corporate players in, albeit once appropriate checks and balances are in place to ensure systemic stability,” Kamath wrote.Explaining his logic, Kamath said risks for allowing corporate houses in banking sector were true of any sector. “The question is how we mitigate this risk with checks and balances,” Kamath said.Both Rajan and Acharya are strongly opposed to the idea of letting private businesses in the business of banking. In an article written jointly and shared on a social media platform, Rajan and Acharya described the IWG's most important recommendation—letting businesses own banks—as a ""bombshell"".While the proposals were tempered with many caveats, they raised an important question, they said. “Why now? Have we learnt something that allows us to override all the prior cautions on allowing industrial houses into banking?” the authors said.The RBI has been hesitant in letting large businesses promote banks. Rajan and Acharya questioned the urgency and timing of the proposal. “After all, committees are rarely set up out of the blue. Is there some dramatic change in perception that it is responding to,” they said.In the appendix of the report, the IWG report said all experts it consulted barring one opposed the idea of corporate entry into banking. “Yet, it recommends the change,” Rajan and Acharya said.The RBI has thrice issued licences to private banks since the nationalisation of banks. In the first round in 1993-94, the RBI gave licences to 10 private sector banks—Global Trust Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd, UTI Bank Ltd (renamed Axis Bank Ltd), Bank of Punjab, IndusInd Bank Ltd, Centurion Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank Ltd, Times Bank and Development Credit Bank Ltd. Some of these banks do not exist now as they were acquired by stronger banks.In 2003-04, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd were allowed in. In 2014, IDFC First Bank and Bandhan Bank were given the licence.The IWG proposals have come with certain riders. Large corporate and industrial houses may be allowed as promoters of banks only after necessary amendments to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.This is aimed at preventing connected lending and exposures between the banks and other financial and non-financial group entities and strengthening of the supervisory mechanism for large conglomerates, including consolidated supervision."

ICICI Bank,20 Nov 2020,RBI report: Doors could be finally open to large business houses to launch banks,"The big takeaway from the report of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)’s internal working group (IWG) on ownership guidelines for private banks is the proposal to allow large corporate and industrial houses to promote private banks.In the past, the RBI has been largely hesitant to let large businesses promote banks.In the previous rounds, when the RBI had issued private bank licences, the banking regulator had permitted corporate houses to apply, but turned down their applications, and preferred financial institutions which had experience in banking transactions.That approach may change now.The proposal, however, comes with certain riders. According to the IWG recommendations, large corporate/industrial houses may be allowed as promoters of banks only after necessary amendments to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.This is aimed at preventing connected lending and exposures between the banks and other financial and non-financial group entities and strengthening of the supervisory mechanism for large conglomerates, including consolidated supervision.The other major takeaway from the proposals is to allow large non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) to convert into banks. Well-run large NBFCs, with an asset size of Rs50,000 crore and above, including those which are owned by a corporate house, may be considered for conversion into banks, subject to completion of 10 years of operations and meeting due diligence criteria and compliance with additional conditions specified in this regard.This too will help many corporate houses running NBFCs under their fold to become banks if they wish to do so.The last time (2013-14) when the RBI invited applications for new private banks, a host of corporates including Tata Sons; the Aditya Birla Nuvo, part of the Aditya Birla conglomerate; L&T Finance Holdings, part of India's largest engineering conglomerate Larsen & Toubro; Reliance Capital; and INMACS Management Services Ltd, which provides management consultancy, corporate finance, audit, tax, and legal advisory services, had applied for permits.Only Bandhan and IDFC got licences.Focus on NOHCsThe IWG group has put lot of emphasis on the Non-operative Financial Holding Company (NOFHC) model. NOFHCs should continue to be the preferred structure for all new licences to be issued for universal banks. However, it should be mandatory only in cases where the individual promoters/promoting entities/converting entities have other group entities, the group has said.While banks licensed before 2013 may move to an NOFHC structure at their discretion, once the NOFHC structure attains a tax-neutral status, all banks licensed before 2013 shall move to the NOFHC structure within five years from announcement of tax-neutrality, the report said.Till the NOFHC structure is made feasible and operational, the concerns with regard to banks undertaking different activities through subsidiaries/ joint ventures/associates need to be addressed through suitable regulations. However, banks currently under the NOFHC structure may be allowed to exit from such a structure if they do not have other group entities in their fold.The RBI has issued bank licences in three rounds since liberalization. In the first round in 1993-94, the RBI gave licences to 10 private sector banks, namely Global Trust Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd, UTI Bank Ltd (renamed Axis Bank Ltd), Bank of Punjab, IndusInd Bank Ltd, Centurion Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank Ltd, Times Bank, and Development Credit Bank Ltd.In 2003-04, two more banks were given licences—Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd. In 2014 IDFC First Bank and Bandhan Bank were given the licence.The different guidelines on capital norms and ownership guidelines in each round had created confusion on appropriate rules. It is in this context that the IWG proposals are important.The proposals have clearly said the RBI should take steps to ensure harmonisation and uniformity in different licensing guidelines, to the extent possible. Whenever new licensing guidelines are issued, if new rules are more relaxed, benefit should be given to existing banks, and if new rules are tougher, legacy banks should also conform to new tighter regulations, but a non-disruptive transition path may be provided to affected banks, it said in its report.Promoter holdingThere seems to be an attempt for consensus with respect to the percentage of stake the private bank promoter can eventually hold. The cap on promoters’ stake in the long run (15 years) may be raised from the current level of 15 per cent to 26 per cent of the paid-up voting equity share capital of the bank, the RBI group has said.As regards non-promoter shareholding, a uniform cap of 15 per cent of the paid-up voting equity share capital of the bank may be prescribed for all types of shareholders, the proposals said.There were tussles between private bank promoters and the regulator with respect to promoter holding. Private sector lender, Kotak Mahindra Bank had taken the regulator to court in connection with a dispute on promoter Uday Kotak’s holding. The RBI let the promoters, Uday Kotak and family, retain 26 percent stake, but capped the voting rights at 15 percent.Similarly, the RBI had taken some punitive actions on Bandhan Bank for failing to reduce promoter holding. The restrictions were withdrawn after the bank complied with the regulations."

ICICI Bank,05 Nov 2020,"Good time to build a portfolio, brokerages pick 20 stocks for 13-49% return","Recent data suggests that the economy is on the path to recovery. The September quarter earnings along with management commentaries also seem to point to that as the government continues its efforts to revive demand.The equity benchmarks have been marching towards the record highs seen in January 2020. The BSE Sensex reclaimed 41,000-mark on November 5 and the Nifty50 hit 12,100, though some part of the rally is fuelled by by US elections.Both indices have gained around 60 percent from the lows of March 23, with midcap and smallcap mirroring the performance.""Overall we remain cautiously optimistic – cautious due to valuations and growth uncertainty for India, optimistic because there are some visible signs that consumption is reviving. Expanding central bank balance sheets and strong inflows into equity markets have kept the markets buoyant over the last six months, any reversal, on this may impact the overall bullish sentiment,"" Mihir Vora, Director & Chief Investment Officer at Max Life Insurance told Moneycontrol.He said the overall themes remained the same—consumption revival, exporters and Make-in-India plays.Axis Securities, too, is confident about digital, pharmaceuticals, private banks, telecom, staples, personal transportation and rural themes and also sees potential in housing in 2021.""Even as uncertainty could continue post US elections, fiscal stimulus likelihood will rise and the dollar could weaken, which will benefit the emerging markets. 2021 is likely to be a good year for the emerging markets as inflows are likely,"" the brokerage said.Given the outperformance of midcaps and smallcaps over largecaps, especially after the September quarter earnings, analysts say this is the right time to build a portfolio.Here is the list of 20 stocks that can return 13-49 percent:Brokerage: Axis SecuritiesICICI BankICICI Bank is well placed with stable NIM, low cost of funds and healthy capital adequacy. The recent capital raise has improved Tier I to 17.9 percent, which provides adequate balance sheet buffer. We believe valuations are undemanding for the stock, given the strong liability franchise and leveraging opportunities across group products. We remain positive on the stock and maintain buy with SOTP of Rs 504.Manappuram FinanceWe believe that credit costs will remain high on asset quality concerns for the non-old business. We expect cost optimisation to aid profitability. Balance sheet liquidity remains comfortable with no funding challenges. While cautious on the non-gold business, we believe gold business will support overall performance in uncertain macro conditions. We expect MGFL to maintain ROAE of around 24 percent over FY21/FY22. Gold lending is a high moat business and specialists like MGFL will continue to benefit.Can Fin HomesWhile loan growth moderation is expected along with slight asset quality deterioration on account of Covid-19, we expect the company to recover faster than its peers due to its loan mix and negligible developer exposure. Lower cost of funds should aid the company in maintaining NIMs while the loan mix profile skewed towards salaried segment will help in maintaining asset quality. We expect lower provisions and improved NIM for FY21E.

At CMP, the stock trades at an attractive 9.6x FY23 EPS, leaving enough room for an upside.Varun BeveragesWe expect VBL to register revenues/earnings CAGR of 11/29 percent, respectively, over CY19-22E. This growth will be driven by 1) consolidation in newly acquired territories, 2) distribution led market share gains, 3) cost efficiencies and margin tailwinds (cost rationalization and benign RM) should support EBITDA margin in CY20E despite weak operating leverage.CCL ProductsWe believe CCLP is well placed to deliver steady earnings over the medium term given 1) expertise in customised blends & cost-efficient business model, 2) long-standing client relationships (around 50 percent revenue contribution from brand owners) 3) largest exporter of instant coffee in India 4) presence in Vietnam, world’s largest Robusta growing country 5) capacity additions in value-added products (FDC & small packs) and 6) steadily improving branded retail business.Endurance TechnologiesWe expect Endurance Technologies to outperform the industry, given its sticky relations with OEMs, broad product basket, market leadership with market share of around 35 percent in suspensions, 25 percent in hydraulic braking system, 20 percent in disc braking system and 16 percent in transmission. New products along with tailwinds for the two-wheeler sector will support Endurance Technologies.Steel Strips WheelsBeing in an oligopoly market, SSWL commands leadership with a market share of around 55 percent in steel wheel rims and around 20 percent in alloy wheels. We expect SSWL to outperform the industry given its sticky relations with OEMs across all auto segments—2/3W, PV, CV, and tractors.Minda IndustriesWe are bullish on MNDA’s ability to comprehensively beat industry performance by 1) leveraging the broader vehicular trends of industry like EV, premiumisation, automation 2) strategic inorganic acquisition to enhance product offering and gain market share 3) maintaining balance sheet discipline and maintain optimal leverage, 4) investing In R&D to bring technological change 5) tap its deep-rooted relationship with OEMs to increase kit value. Given its success in developing import substitution products, it would be able to capture the business opportunities offered by the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ move in the auto sector.

Biocon management has set an ambitious target to cross $1 billion revenues for biologics over the next couple of years (from around $300 plus million in FY20). Biocon is targeting eight different biosimilars to be sold by FY22, thereby addressing a market size of $33 billion.

Deepak and Chanda were questioned by the ED in the past and they had, along with the other case accused, denied all allegations. VIEL, SEPL, VIL, NRL, Deepak, Chanda and Videocon Group’s Managing Director VN Dhoot were cited as accused in the case by ED.ED arrests Deepak KochharOn September 8, the agency arrested Deepak Kochhar. ED had registered its case under the provisions of PMLA on the basis of a case registered by the CBI in January 2019 for cheating, conspiracy and misconduct by public servants under the Indian Penal Code and Prevention of Corruption Act.The CBI had registered its case on the basis of the findings of the agency’s year-long probe as part of its preliminary enquiry, a precursor to the registration of a regular case, which commenced in December 2017.ED investigation showed that the residential property of Chanda Kochhar, worth Rs 5.25 crore in Mumbai, was bought in 1996 by Credential Finance Ltd, in which Videocon was having a substantial interest, along with Deepak and Chanda Kochhar. CFL defaulted the loan worth of Rs 4.7 crore, which it took from Videocon.Subsequently, the ownership transferred to Quality Techno Advisors Pvt Ltd, and then its whole shareholding was acquired by Quality Advisors, a family trust of Deepak Kochhar, for just Rs 11 lakh."

Approval for gProAir (queries should be responded by partner towards end of this year) and a launch of gAdvair are expected to be the key catalysts in near term.

Cipla remains our top pick in the large cap space,"" said Dolat Capital.Alkem Laboratories""Alkem has built a decent platform for growth in the US with its diversified manufacturing base (6 FDA approved facilities including 2 in the US), pipeline of around 90 ANDAs (only 50 percent commercialized) and front-end presence. US business targets 12-15 filings and around 10 launches per annum. With sales force expansion spend in base and enhanced digital marketing tools, we expect steady EBITDA margin at around 20 percent over FY21-23 versus 17 percent earlier.

A better product mix in branded generics (70 percent of sales) pushed its gross margin up 420bps to 78 percent. Lower R&D/marketing overheads expanded the EBITDA margin 1,067bps to around 38 percent. Earnings are likely to be driven by its branded generics in India, the Rest of Asia and Africa, on improving prospects.

Considering management’s focus on growth/margins in CPs, tightening WC leading to FCF and shrinking debt in EPC, we expect healthy liquidity and significant interest-cost savings in coming years.

Power generation revenue fell 23 percent YoY, mainly due to lower MHP sales. Other segments in PG have started seeing traction and the overall PG business was 80 percent of last year's levels. The company expects the situation for PG to improve gradually. Exports were up 8 percent YoY aided by fire-fighting equipment.

Our EBITDA estimates are broadly unchanged (increase of 2.5 percent/2.0 percent for FY22/FY23 respectively) while target EV/EBITDA multiple is also intact at 12x and our upgrade is primarily driven by the recent correction in stock price which provides an attractive entry point,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher.Ramco Cements""TRCL surprised in Q2 with realization improvement.

Tata Steel,17 Nov 2020,"Need more support from UK govt to secure operations in long term, says Tata Steel CEO Narendran","Tata Steel has asked the UK government for more ""substantive and permanent"" options that will secure the company's operations in the country in the long term.""The support we are looking for is a little more substantive and something more permanent, that will help us bring down cost of production and add value to the product mix. Or, help us over a period of time in making a transition to a greener facility,"" Tata Steel CEO and Managing Director TV Narendran said in response to a Moneycontrol query, during a media briefing on November 17.Narendran added that while the company has already got financial assistance from the UK government, this was more immediate in nature to help the company's present cash flow. The support is something that the government is giving to all companies, to tide over the impact of COVID-19.The top executive however declined to quantify the support. He added: ""That is not enough to make the business going in the long term.""The UK unit of Tata Steel's European operations is under focus as the company has now engaged with Sweden's SSAB to sell the Dutch arm. On November 13, Tata Steel made official its talks with SSAB and said that it may take about six months to complete the process.Both the UK and Dutch operations till now came under Tata Steel Europe. But now the two will be separated and the bigger and more profitable Dutch unit will be taken over by SSAB.The Netherlands operations contribute about 70 percent of Tata Steel Europe business, and there have been concerns about the UK unit - which has struggled most historically - managing by itself.The European operations come from Tata Steel's acquisition of Corus in 2006, a $13 billion-deal that the company has struggled to manage since then.At the same time, the potential deal with SSAB will help the company partly or completely clear the debt of Euros 1.7 billion that Tata Steel Europe has. While the company has till now been mum on the deal value, industry observers put it at multi-billion dollars.But will a standalone UK operations put a drain on its Indian parent?Narendran doesn't think so.""Last six months, Tata Steel Europe has been cash positive and neutral and hasn't got support from India. The UK operations are within sight of meeting the target of being self-sustainable,"" he said.""The mandate,"" Narendran added, ""is to run without India's support.""It will give confidence that the European market has recovered well, with demand for steel picking up, especially from the auto industry. Though the company's consolidated net profit in the second quarter fell by over a half year-on-year, it swung to profitability after three quarters of losses."

Tata Steel,13 Nov 2020,Tata Steel confirms talks with Sweden's SSAB to sell Dutch unit,"Tata Steel has confirmed that it's in talks with Sweden's SSAB to sell its unit in the Netherlands, the flagship of its operations in Europe.This is a fresh attempt from India's largest steelmaker to find a solution to its troubles in Europe, more than a year after a merger with Germany's thyssenkrupp was blocked by European Commission.The company said it has ""commenced discussions with the Supervisory Board and Board of Management of Tata Steel Netherlands and the process will move to the next stage including due diligence and stakeholders’ consultations."" The Netherlands unit has an annual capacity of 7.5 million tonne and has 10,000 employees.Proceeds from the sale will be used to lower the debt on the company's books. Tata Steel Europe has a debt of 1.7 billion Euros.Simultaneously, the company has also begun the process of separating Tata Steel Netherlands and Tata Steel UK, and ""will pursue separate strategic paths for the Netherlands and the UK business in the future"", it said. The company has been in talks with the UK government for financial aid to shore up its operations in the country.""There will be stages in this transaction, and will close it in six to nine months,"" Executive Director and CFO Koushik Chatterjee, said during an analyst call on November 13.CEO and Managing Director TV Narendran added that the company is ""not expecting competition commission issues"" like in its earlier proposed merger with Germany's thyssenkrupp.The merger with thyseenkrupp was blocked by the European Commission in 2019, and turned out to be a big setback for Tata Steel in its attempt to find a solution to the European puzzle. Since its 2006 acquisition of Corus, which was later renamed Tata Steel Europe, the operations have for most of the years incurred losses and were dependent on the Indian parent to stay afloat.The Commission had said that the merged entity, which would have been the second largest in Europe after ArcelorMittal, would have hurt competition in some of the segments, including  packaging steel, auto-grade steel and electrical steel.The company is now hoping that the deal with SSAB will have a better fate with the Commission. Narendran said that the merged entity, that of Tata  Steel Netherlands and SSAB, won't have a significant presence in packaging or auto steel.SSAB is known for making steel that is used in making machinery and equipment that have application in mining, earth moving and construction segments.What happens to Tata Steel UK?The big question is now on the future of the UK operations, which have been the biggest drag on the company. Overall in Europe, about 70 to 80 percent of the EBITDA comes from the Dutch unit.The UK operations, which churn out about 5 million tons of steel a year, have been a subject of much debate and consternation, as was again seen during the analyst call on Friday, as many analysts repeatedly asked about the future of the unit.Narendran reiterated that the focus of the company is make the UK operations self-sustainable and not dependent on cash injections from the Indian parent. ""In the last six months, which have been very challenging, the UK operations have not needed help,"" he said."

Also, L&T Special Steels & Heavy Forgings and Kalyani Carpenter Special Steels Ltd, are among other players.""But some of the automakers, especially the multinational ones, prefer to source steel from companies of their own countries,"" says a senior executive from a private steel maker.Otherwise too, adds another executive, only 2 percent of the specialised steel used in the auto sector, is at present imported.Even in electrical steel, it is only some of the niche products that are imported.

We are optimistic that a floor price would soon be introduced, at which ONGC would make money (its average production cost is US$3.7/mmbtu). Floor price may be US$4.2/mmbtu, which ONGC has asked for since FY17, or linked to JKM spot LNG. Reports also suggest GoI may gradually deregulate price of nomination acreage (APM) gas over not more than six years. This may be the roadmap for uniform market-determined price for all gas produced in India, which the oil minister has often talked of.

However, there was a reduction in gas production due to less off-take by some customers, which has now been restored to normal levels. Production guidance in FY21 for oil stood at ~22.7mmt and for gas at ~24.9bcm. -OPEC+ managed production cuts well (in line with demand), as various economies globally came out of the lockdowns. Thus, crude oil prices hovered around ~USD45/bbl over the last two months. Starting Aug’20, OPEC+ also eased production cuts by 2mnbopd (to 7.7mnbopd). Global demand is expected to reach ~97% of pre-COVID levels in the next quarter (Oct-Dec’20). We have built in crude oil price forecast of ~USD45/bbl for 2HFY21 and we expect prices to remain stable around current levels in the medium term. ONGC has guided that KG basin will see some delay in production as many vendors have enforced force majeure. Despite domestic gas price ceiling declining, KG basin's production would not be impacted.

A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Apart from speaking on COVID-19, the RIL Chairman said bold reforms undertaken by the Union government will lead to swift economic recovery.Speaking on the issue of energy, the RIL Chairman said the future of energy is being ""shaped by unprecedented changes"". He said India needs to pursue two goals - to become an economic superpower and a ""green and clean energy"" superpower.""We need disruptive solutions in renewables, low carbon and carbon recycle technologies to achieve this goal.

Reliance,21 Nov 2020,Here's the full text of Mukesh Ambani's speech at the PDPU convocation,"Reliance Industries (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani on November 21 spoke at the 8th Convocation of Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University (PDPU).Here's what Ambani said during the virtual address:Honourable Chief Minister of Gujarat, Shri Vijay Rupaniji, my fellow members of the Board, faculty, teachers, staff, students, parents, and my dear friends,A very warm good morning to each and every one of you. I wish all of you good health and safety. I hope that you are all taking necessary precautions to keep yourself and your dear ones safe and protected.India has entered a crucial phase in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot afford to let our guards down at this juncture.We are extremely privileged to have the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India, Sh Narendrabhai Modi, as the chief guest for today’s event. His passionate and dynamic leadership has made the world sit up and take notice of the emergence of a New India.His confidence and conviction have inspired and galvanised the entire nation.I am sure that the bold reforms introduced under his leadership will pave the way for India’s swift recovery and rapid economic progress in the years to come.Friends, all of us know that PDPU itself is a product of Honourable Prime Minister Narendrabhai's ""Atmanirbhar"" vision.It is a vision he cherished even when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat...to make India self-reliant in the areas of Energy, Energy Education, Research and Innovation.PDPU is only fourteen years old. Yet, it already ranks among the Top-25 in the Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievements.In terms of diversity, we attract international students from across the world. We have 284 international students from 39 countries.And from a total of 132 students in the first convocation in 2009, we have 2,608 students, including 46 PhDs, graduating today.From National Rankings, I am sure PDPU will soon earn a place in global rankings.My dear teachers, PDPU has world-class physical infrastructure. But what gives me far greater joy is that PDPU has world-class faculty as well. Your dedication and commitment to excellence has been exemplary.In the best practice of India's Guru Parampara, you have always gone beyond the call of duty. You have been friends, guides and mentors to your students. Let's take a moment to appreciate the leadership, faculty and all the staff of PDPU.Friends, today I have a special reason to applaud PDPU. The COVID-19 pandemic has cast a shadow on the academic lives and careers of students across the world.Precious hours of academic engagement, debate and research have been lost in lockdowns. Yet, our very own PDPU did exceptionally well even in these challenging times.The flame of teaching and learning at PDPU shone brightest even during the darkest days of the pandemic. Our faculty continued to present award-winning research papers in national and international conferences. Our students continued to enjoy co-curricular and extra-curricular activities held digitally.These facts make me proud of our university. But my heart swelled with greater pride when I learnt that PDPU also contributed to the nation's fight against COVID-19. Our teachers and students designed several medical equipment, including an ICU ventilator.I salute the leadership of PDPU for combining Jnana with Seva. This combination is the greatest badge of honour for any educational institution.Dear members of the PDPU Community, our accomplishments so far have been a source of joy.However, we have to prepare ourselves to scale still higher summits of success.The future of energy is being shaped by unprecedented changes. And these changes are impacting the future of humanity — indeed, the very future of our planet.The most important question we face is this:Can we produce the growing amounts of energy we need to sustain our economies without harming the environment?...Without failing to fulfil our climate change obligations? We must be prepared to answer this question with a CONFIDENT ""YES""!By the middle of this century, the world will use twice as much energy as we use today. In the next two decades, India’s own per-capita energy needs will be more than twice as much as today.Therefore, India is required to simultaneously pursue two goals: To become an economic superpower. To become a green and clean energy superpower.To achieve these twin goals, we need disruptive solutions in renewables, low carbon and carbon recycle technologies. We need breakthroughs in new energy sources such as green and blue hydrogen. We also need great innovations in energy storage, saving and utilisation.As a person from the energy business, I can assure the students and faculty of PDPU that you are entering an exciting future.What makes it even more exciting is the synergy between the Energy Revolution and the Fourth Industrial Revolution. If we master this synergy, we will surely be able to make India one of the most prosperous nations in the world. An India that guarantees prosperity and wellbeing for all 1.3 billion Indians.Honourable Chief Minister Shri Rupani ji, Gujarat is a trailblazer state. It has always shown the pioneer spirit. Today the entire world acknowledges that NEW GUJARAT has paved the path for NEW INDIA. The visionary leadership of Shri Narendra Modi ji that Gujarat received is now available to the nation.I must compliment you and your team for making Vibrant Gujarat even more vibrant under the guidance of Shri Modi ji and Shri Amit Shah ji.Here is our solemn assurance to you today. PDPU will continue to make its unique contribution to enhancing the reputation of Gujarat and India in energy education and research.My dear Young Graduates, I see in you, 2,608 future builders of a strong, proud and vibrant India. My heartiest congratulations to you on your success. May all your dreams come true as you embark on a new journey in your life.However, always remember an important life lesson. Learning is a constant and never-ending process of exploration, discovery and adventure. A true student never stops the pursuit of knowledge.Therefore, here is my message to you, and I am only repeating Mahatma Gandhi's wise words: ""Learn for life, Learn through life, and Learn throughout life"".I have another message for you. When you step out of this beautiful campus, you will no doubt carry wonderful memories with you.But perhaps you will also carry some concern, some uncertainty, some anxiety about the future.This is only natural. The COVID situation will likely accentuate your thoughts and feelings.Therefore, I would like to tell you with great emphasis today...venture out with supreme hope and confidence. The future is very bright for India, for you, and for all Indians.This, our ancient nation, has faced many adversities in the past. And has emerged stronger each time. This is because resilience is in the very DNA of Indian people, Indian culture.In the post-COVID era, I clearly foresee explosive and exponential growth in the Indian economy. Within a couple of decades, India will be among the top three economies in the world.Growth will create unprecedented opportunities and possibilities for young and talented people like you. Indeed, most of these opportunities will be created by young entrepreneurs themselves. I see many amongst you as the creators of successful startups.The world is waiting for you. Step out and take the plunge. Fail, if necessary, but in pursuit of your dreams. With passion, purpose and persistent effort, your dreams will indeed come true.We, at PDPU, take pride in now calling you our alumni – our ambassadors. Make all of us at PDPU proud. Make your parents proud. Make India proud.Once again, my hearty congratulations to the Class of 2019 and 2020. Good luck and God bless.Thank you."

RIL reported a consolidated profit of Rs 13,248 crore for the first quarter of FY21 with Jio's ARPU growth of 7.4 percent QoQ at Rs 140.3 per subscriber per month beating Street expectations.""The severe demand destruction due to global lockdowns impacted our hydrocarbons business but the flexibility in our operations enabled us to operate at near normal levels and deliver industry leading results,"" Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director said.""Our consumer facing businesses became the life-line for individuals and businesses with our Retail and Jio teams working hard to ensure millions got essential goods and services through the lockdown,"" he added.Consolidated profit during June quarter 2020 (which included exceptional gain of Rs 4,966 crore from stake sale to BP in Reliance BP Mobility) increased 102.4 percent sequentially and the year-on-year increase was 30.6 percent.Consolidated profit in March quarter 2020 stood at Rs 6,348 crore and Rs 10,141 crore in the corresponding period of last year.In the March quarter, the company had reported an exceptional loss of Rs 4,267 crore due to fall in oil prices.

I thank the millions of individual investors who supported our Rights Issue and welcome all our new partners to an exciting new phase of growth at Reliance.”RIL's digital unit Jio Platforms, which raised Rs 1,52,056 crore during the quarter under review from some of the world’s top tech investors led by Facebook, was one of the few companies to have grown during the coronavirus lockdown.With the fund raising from stake sale in Jio Platforms, Rights issue of Rs 53,124 crore and stake sale to BP in petro-retail joint venture, Reliance achieved its net debt free target in June 2020, which is well ahead of its timeline March 31, 2021.Reliance Industries said it, post completion of these investments, would hold 66.48 percent equity stake in Jio Platform on a fully diluted basis.""Of the total investment, Jio Platform Limited has already received Rs  1,15,694 crore as subscription amount from ten investors. Rs 22,981 crore will be retained at Jio Platform to drive future growth,"" it added.Work from home boosted Jio’s data consumption. Reliance Jio, the wholly owned subsidiary of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries, has reported profit at Rs 2,520 crore for the June quarter 2020, rising 8.1 percent over Rs 2,331 crore in March quarter.Average revenue per user (ARPU) for the June quarter at Rs 140.3 per subscriber per month grew by 7.4 percent compared to Rs 130.6 in previous quarter. It was much higher than street expectations.Prakash Diwan of Altamount Capital told CNBC-TV18 that there is no reason why Jio ARPU won't go up further. ""Retail will be the next big galloping horse. We don't expect any selling pressure on RIL stock and Rs 2,300 zone may get tested in August,"" he said.The stock touched a record high of Rs 2,198.70 on July 27 and brokerages increased their target price due to deleveraging of the Balance Sheet and stake sale in Jio Platforms to global investors and technology players.In fact, it has been the biggest gainer among Nifty stocks, rising 145 percent from its March 23 low, and gaining 41 percent year-to-date.Work from home (WHF) boosts Jio’s data consumption and despite lockdown restrictions, the subscriber base grew robustly to 398.3 million at the end of June quarter (compared to 388 million in March quarter) as both voice and data traffic surged.Total wireless data traffic during the quarter was at 1,420 crore GB (30.2 percent YoY growth) with strong customer engagement and best-in-class network performance, company said.Jio's revenue in June quarter increased 11.6 percent sequentially to Rs 16,557 crore, and EBITDA surged 17.4 percent quarter-on-quarter to Rs 7,281 crore and margin jumped 220 bps QoQ to 44 percent during the quarter, which all came in above analysts expectations.Revenue was expected at Rs 15,800 crore with EBITDA at Rs 6,700 crore and margin at 42.4 percent for the quarter, according to CNBC-TV18 poll estimates.Two RIL platforms -- JioMart and JioMeet -- which were rolled out during Q1 benefitted from huge downloads.JioMart beta version was launched in 200 cities to meet consumer needs. Both voice and data traffic surged.Reliance Retail: Against the backdrop of a challenging environment, where store functioning and digital commerce fulfilment was severely impacted by lockdown and restrictions (50 percent stores were fully shut, 29 percent partially operated), Reliance Retail clocked significant revenues of Rs 31,633 crore and EBITDA of Rs 1,083 crore in the quarter, company said.""The performance whilst muted by the operating context, was well ahead of market,"" it added. Retail revenue in June quarter 2019 was at Rs 38,216 crore and EBITDA at Rs 2,060 crore.RIL said EBITDA was positive and resilient despite the limitations in the quarter, with cost management initiatives leading to fixed cost savings, which helped cushion the impact of lower profits from lower sales.Despite gross margin expansion and cost savings, EBITDA margin was impacted by fixed costs and adverse mix (with the most profitable Fashion & Lifestyle categories being hit the hardest), coming in at 3.8 percent during the quarter against 6.0 percent during the corresponding period of the previous year, it added.Reliance said the quarter saw 21 percent growth year-on-year across the operational businesses of Grocery and Connectivity, while Consumer Electronics and Fashion and Lifestyle businesses were hit particularly hard by the cessation of activity during the lockdown period, as stores were closed for the most part of the quarter.On the petrochemicals front, Reliance said revenue for Q1FY21 declined by 33 percent YoY to Rs 25,192 crore primarily due to lower price realizations with disruptions in local and regional markets amid COVID-19 outbreak.EBITDA for the quarter declined 49.7 percent YoY to Rs 4,430 crore. ""Weak domestic demand and higher share of exports impacted margins as compared to regional benchmarks. The impact of lower realization was partially offset by cost optimization and integration benefits,"" company said.Q1 was a very challenging quarter as due to lockdown, domestic industry and supply chains virtually came to a halt as both producers and converters shut down plants across India, it added.In case of refining and marketing business, Reliance said revenues for June quarter 2020 declined by 54.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 46,642 crore due to lower crude oil price and lower throughput.Brent crude price averaged at $29.2 a barrel during the quarter versus $68.8 a barrel in Q1FY20, down 57.6 percent YoY.Regional Benchmark Singapore Complex Margins turned negative for the first time in 2 decades and averaged at $-0.9 a barrel.Reliance said its gross refining margins at $6.3 a barrel was impacted by lower product cracks and narrower light-heavy crude differential. However, it maintained a significant premium of $7.2 a barrel over regional benchmark margin.Refining and marketing EBITDA declined to Rs 3,818 crore (down 25.8 percent YoY) due to weak margin environment and lower throughput, RIL said, adding refining segment profitability was sustained through optimized crude procurement, relatively higher utilization, cost management and agile product placement.RIL is now one of the 50 most valued companies globally with a market capitalisation of Rs 13.92 lakh crore at its record high price.Promoters' shareholding stood at 50.37 percent in the June quarter up from 50.07 percent in the March quarter, while foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) raised their stake to 24.72 percent from 24.05 percent in the same period.Find all earnings related news here(This is a developing story.

However, the counter started to see traction after brokerages kept faith in the stock.Brokerage firm CLSA maintained a ""buy"" call on HDFC Bank with a target price of Rs 1,700.CLSA, as per CNBC-TV18, said that RBI got tough on system outages and while the business impact was manageable, a long-term fix was important.""If restrictions stay for over three-six months, then there could be some impact in FY22,"" CLSA said.CLSA underscored that banks like ICICI and SBI, too, faced outages but these were less severe.Motilal Oswal Financial Services also maintained a ""buy"" call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,500.""HDFC Bank indicated that the RBI order will not have an impact on its existing credit cards business and operations of the bank. However, this order could likely delay the launch of the digital auto loan financing portal, which the management has guided for during 2QFY21,"" Motilal Oswal said.The timeline of lifting the orders would be a key monitorable and ""we remain watchful on future developments in this regard"", it said. ""At the current juncture, we do not see any meaningful risk to our estimates and continue to maintain our buy rating with a target price of Rs 1,500 (3.3 times Sep’22E ABV),"" Motilal Oswal added.Edelweiss Securities also maintained a buy call with a target price of Rs 1,490 and said the stock continued to be among its top two sectoral picks.""We continue to put a premium on resilience, which is what HDFC Bank offers—a strong balance sheet and likely higher residual capital than most,"" Edelweiss Securities said.""This higher residual capital ensures that its best-in-class franchise can support an adequately large balance sheet after this crisis and fulfill its earnings potential. In terms of the gap between reported net worth and ‘true residual equity’, the bank is in the top quartile in our coverage universe,"" the brokerage firm said.Brokerage firm JM Financial also maintained a buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,440.""We believe that RBI is indicating a non-tolerant stance towards technological lapses in the banking infrastructure. Given HDFC Bank’s dominant status in payments/credit cards and its strong commitment to tech-enabled growth, this development comes as a negative surprise,"" JM Financial said.The brokerage firm added that it continues to believe HDFC Bank should be able to resolve the issues and assuage the regulatory concerns satisfactorily over the medium term.Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities pointed out that after a sharp uptrend rally from Rs 1,150 to Rs 1,320, the stock is now consolidating near its all-time high level.""The momentum indicators indicate that the stock is in an overbought zone and there are high chances of a short-term correction if it starts trading below the Rs 1,440 resistance level,"" Chouhan said.However, Chouhan added that on the daily as well as weekly charts, the stock is still in a strong uptrend, so any meaningful correction should be the opportunity for the investor to add long positions near important support levels.""For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,440 should act as a key resistance level. If it trades below the same, then the correction could take the stocks towards Rs 1,350-1,340. On the flip side, Rs 1,440 would be the immediate hurdle for the bulls, and if trades consistently above the same, then the trend could well take the stock towards Rs 1,525,"" said Chouhan."
HDFC Bank,03 Dec 2020,"HDFC Bank outage | Working on war footing to strengthen IT infrastructure, will comply with RBI requirements: CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan","After the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) temporarily stopped launch of all new digital products of HDFC Bank, its new CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan on December 3 said the bank will comply with the RBI regulations and will wait for the regulator’s clearance before launching new products.“We had two outages, one in November 2018 and second in December 2019. We have taken help of external expertise, understood what needs to be done further and have substantially implemented the inputs to strengthen our IT infrastructure and systems,” Jagdishan said in a letter to customers.“Unexpectedly another incident happened on November 21,2020, and the primary reason for the same is the power outage in our primary data centre. We are working on war footing to strengthen this area also now,” Jagdishan said.Jagdishan assured customers that there is no reason to worry. “You can continue to transact with the bank without any concern,” he said.Jagdishan apologised for the digital outage to customers. “We realize that as our valued customer, you expect us to maintain a very high standard of service quality and experience. And sometimes, we have not been able to live up to your expectations. For that, please accept our sincere apologies,” the CEO said in the letter.The RBI asked HDFC Bank to temporarily halt sourcing new credit cards and stop the launch of its digital business-generating activities planned under Digital 2.0 and other proposed business generating IT applications.The RBI issued the order dated December 2, 2020, to HDFC Bank.The central bank on November 23 had sought an explanation from HDFC Bank after its digital services faced disruptions on the evening of November 21 till November 22 morning - for over 12 hours.The order also states that HDFC Bank’s board must examine the lapses and fix accountability.“The above measures shall be considered for lifting (the restrictions) upon satisfactory compliance with the major critical observations as identified by the RBI,” it added.New launches after RBI’s clearanceJagdishan said the bank will now launch its digital initiatives after getting the RBI’s approvals.“Some of our strategic digital initiatives to improve the front-end digital experience, improve digital origination, straight through processing, next generation of mobile and internet banking, API-based banking on the edge etc would now be readied and launched post the approval and clearance from the regulator,” the CEO said in the letter.Further, the bank will work with experts and the regulator to fortify the identified areas for improvement. “Internally, we are looking at this as an opportunity to further improve ourselves and emerge stronger,” Jagdishan said.Banks are under immense pressure because of the competition to come up with new digital banking products, often without proper testing and leading to such failures, said senior bankers. “There is intense competition from industry and new players such as payments banks to keep introducing new products. In their anxiety to remain at the top, banks often come with digital banking products that are not fully tested. Banks need to be careful to make sure they have enough technology capabilities to back such products,” said Naresh Malhotra, a senior banking consultant.To be fair, technical glitches aren’t limited to HDFC Bank alone. Other banks too have been facing problems on the technical side, with the latest instance reported on State Bank of India’s (SBI's) mobile banking application, YONO, in the last two days with customers complaining on Twitter that they are unable to login to the application following an error. This issue has not been resolved yet."

HDFC Bank,03 Nov 2020,Large banks hold up well in Q2 but experts say too early to celebrate,"The September quarter earnings show that most banking players, especially the larger ones, held up well despite the coronavirus outbreak but experts say the sector is not completely out of woods yet.Most large private banks reported improved net profits for the second quarter and a modest increase in bad loans, experts said.Top private-sector lenders such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank posted a strong sequential improvement in their profits. They also reported sequential improvement in their gross non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio.The impact of staggered roll back of lockdown restrictions, or “Unlocking”, and resumption of economic activities is visible in the banks’ quarterly results.The opening up of the economy also led to an improvement in loan repayment and a major reduction in the moratorium book but it may be too early to celebrate.Looming uncertaintyA clear picture of how COVID-19 hit the banking sector will emerge only after some quarters once the Reserve Bank of India's support wounds up.According to experts, the challenges for the sector range from an increase in slippages from moratorium books, restructuring the percentage of the loan book to quality growth.Devang Mehta, Head – Equity Advisory, Centrum Wealth Management, said the actual picture of the COVID blow to banks will only emerge over the next couple of quarters, as special dispensations provided by the RBI start to wind down.The gross NPA numbers do not show the full picture of stressed accounts for private banks, he said. It is, however, important to remember that these banks have been providing aggressively during the first six months of this financial year.Nirali Shah, Senior Research Analyst, Samco Securities has a similar view.""Prima facie, it appears that the banking sector managed to tide through one more quarter amid the pandemic with healthy profitability and a modest increase in bad loans. But, the actual pain could emerge only after a few quarters when the special dispensations provided by the RBI start to dwindle,"" Shah said.Shah sees a number of challenges.""The top challenge is reporting of NPLs. Even though most banks have reported sequential improvement in their asset quality, the truth is that the reported NPAs may not have captured all the stress on the bank’s balance sheet. In fact, a proforma number has been reported as the apex court has asked lenders not to classify any new account as NPA after August 31, 2020. This will very well push the NPAs to a future date, causing banks to delay their provision requirement,"" Shah said.Another challenge lies in the amounts reported as restructured loans, which are extremely small to date, he said. The true proportions of restructuring will emerge in the quarters ending December and March.“Collection efficiency reported by banks is still running below their pre-COVID-19 levels, especially on the unsecured side which will be a key measure to watch out for going forward,” said Shah. The road ahead is challenging and a clear picture will be visible only in the quarters to come, he added.As per the RBI’s June 2020 financial stability report, the bad loan rate is expected to climb to 14.2 percent in a severe stress scenario and 12.5 percent in a baseline scenario as of March 2021, which is a bit alarming. Due to standstill benefits banks didn’t recognise further slippages in Q2FY21 but in the next two-three quarters, NPAs are expected to rise.The improvement in collection efficiency after the end of the moratorium on August 31 is positive.September,” Jehan Bhadha, Assistant Vice President - Equity Research at Nirmal Bang said.This figure is expected to improve further by the December quarter. With the encouraging collections, banks have started to accelerate disbursement growth which has reached pre- COVID levels, Bhadha said.Should you avoid the sector?The valuation of some of the banking stocks is cheap at this juncture while the outlook of some has improved. So, one can bet on select players from the sector.Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, said the banking sector is a value buy, given the inexpensive valuation and improved outlook in the long-term.Valuation wise, the Nifty Bank is trading at a 1-year forward P/B of 1.7 times compared to it the last 3 year average of 2.3 times, he said.The challenges have been factored in in the prices and financial stress will reduce as the economy and demand improve.back and reported better operational performance in Q2FY21, even though credit growth has to improve,""  Nair said.""A complete change depends on when the pandemic will subside, which is expected during 2021. Hence, strong buying in the SIP method over the next 6 to 12 months is advisable to build a strong portfolio in banking services.""Nair's top picks are HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank in the private space, Bajaj Finance in NBFC, Bandhan in rural and microfinance and IDFC First as an upcoming bank.Jaikishan Parmar, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Angel Broking, is of the view that due to adequate liquidity and sufficient capital, large banks will gain market share. He has a positive view on ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and IDFC First Bank.Shah from Samco Securities said balance sheets of Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Banks are likely better equipped to sustain the pain than PSUs in the months to come.Mehta of Centrum Wealth Management also likes larger franchises, particularly HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, as they are equipped to handle difficult times and have the potential to gain market share from smaller players.Bhadha of Nirmal Bang is bullish on ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank."

We see a) focus on shoring up provisions (non-specific provisions at 1.7 percent of loans) despite having strong PPOP-profile, b) “retailisation” of deposit base despite decadal low wholesale funding costs and c) a more balanced fee mix which is transaction-oriented than being balance-sheet driven as key indicators for creating a medium-term, steady profitability profile for the bank,"" said JM Financial.

It upgraded the rating to ""buy"" from ""accumulate"" and raised the target to Rs 5,964 from Rs 5,648 as it incorporated Wockhardt acquired brands and COVID led products in estimates.ICICI Prudential Life""We like IPRU's re-engineered business model, which is focused on a more diversified product mix (increasing PAR + NPAR) along with an increased protection share. This is expected to drive margins higher by 405bps YoY in FY21 to 25.8 percent. We expect VNB to grow at FY21-23 CAGR of 14.9 percent.

New business was driven by group savings, protection and recovery in ULIP. This change in business mix kept the margins steady at 18.8 percent (PLe of 19.6 percent) as recovery in ULIP offset the protection margin benefit. Improving protection mix and other higher margin products will help it deliver margins of 19-20 percent by FY22-23E and see strong recovery in business momentum,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher.With the recent underperformance, SBI Life looked attractive, it said, upgrading the stock to ""buy"" from ""accumulate"" and retained the target of Rs 920.Persistent SystemsHDFC Securities upgraded Persistent Systems to ""buy"" due to a structural pivot towards growth acceleration, following underperformance in FY16-20 period.

SBI,14 Dec 2020,"Union Budget 2021 | Focus on growth, look at fiscal management from a 3-year perspective: CII to FM Nirmala Sitharaman","The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has forwarded a three-pronged strategy for Union Budget 2021, centering around the key themes of growth, fiscal consolidation, and strengthening of the financial sector targeted to overcome the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy.The CII has suggested that the budget proposals focus on growth, and alongside look at fiscal management from a three-year perspective. Disinvestment and monetisation of assets can bring in revenues at a time when tax revenues have fallen sharply, said the industry body.The CII presented its recommendations to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on December 14.“The government has an unenviable task of ensuring a fine balance between supporting economic recovery and growth on one hand and ensuring macro-economic stability on the other. The CII’s suggestions take this aspect into cognisance,” said Uday Kotak, President, CII.The CII recommended that the government bring down its stake in public sector banks (PSB) to below 50 percent through the market route, over the next 12 months, except for 3-4 large PSBs such as State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, and the Union Bank of India.It further recommended that the government create state-owned, professionally managed Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) to finance key sectors of the economy, on the lines of KfW Germany, Brazil Development Bank (BNDES), and Korea Development Bank.""This could be achieved by infusing equity into NABARD for financing agriculture and rural sector, SIDBI for financing MSMEs and IIFCL for financing infrastructure,"" the body said.Policy RecommendationsFinancial Sector ReformsGovernment ExpenditureIncrease the expenditure in healthcare to 3 percent of GDP over 3 years.Infrastructure for both rural and urban areas as infrastructure spend has one of the highest multiplier effects on the economy.Focus on sustainability in order to build an environment-friendly modern economy.Further, two most critical areas that require immediate attention – private investment and creation of jobs.Private InvestmentSupport for job creationSection 80JJAA, provides for deduction of 30 percent on emoluments paid to new employees, for three years.

SBI,12 Dec 2020,"Need to have DFIs back into arena, says SBI MD Ashwani Bhatia","There is need for a development finance institution (DFI) for funding long-term needs of the infrastructure sector, State Bank of India managing director Ashwani Bhatia said on December 12.The government is actively considering setting up a DFI to meet the financing need of infrastructure sector which according to National Infrastructure Pipeline report requires a massive funding of Rs 111 lakh crore over the next five-year period ending 2024-25.""My short answer would be yes,"" Bhatia said to a question if the time has come to relook at setting up a DFI in India. ""State Bank of India was a working capital bank in the 80s and 90s. We were pretty much the gold standard. ICICI and IDBI and other got the complete project and then moved on from there. We would love to have DFIs back into the arena,"" he said at a virtual conference organised by Ficci.ICICI and IDBI in previous avatar were DFIs and even the country's oldest financial institution IFCI Ltd acted as DFI. On Friday Economic Affairs Secretary Tarun Bajaj said DFI like entity is needed and there would be some good progress on that front in the months to come.Bajaj had said the government has created a debt platform in the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) for which there was a Cabinet announcement. ""The Government of India is committed to giving Rs 6,000 crores in the next two years…that would be leveraged with debt by NIIF and we will be putting in more than Rs 1 lakh crore into infrastructure sector on the debt side …other than the equity side.""While DFI is in the works, we are also taking other steps to ensure that infrastructure spend happens and both debt and equity are taken care of,"" he said.Meanwhile, ICICI Lombard managing director Bhargav Dasgupta said, ""If we have to do that model (DFI), we probably have to take some of the learnings of the past."""
SBI,12 Dec 2020,SBI will prefer co-origination models of lending to MSMEs: Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara,"State Bank of India (SBI) will prefer the co-origination model to cater to the financing needs of MSMEs and collaboration with fintechs is a good idea as it helps in assessing the risk profile of the borrower in a better manner, its chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara said on Saturday.Pointing out that the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are constrained today in terms of cash flows, time gap in realising receivables, among others and also the level of lenders' confidence in funding them, Khara said collaborating is a better model than lending directly to MSMEs.""The fact of the matter is that today not many NBFCs have come in this space. And of late, when it comes to finding solutions, we feel that apart from lending directly to the MSMEs, there is a way forward in terms of collaborating with these NBFCs along with the biggest fintechs who have the ability to process the structured and unstructured (financial) data to have a better sense in terms of assessment of risk,"" Khara said.Based on that assessment, he said, bankers feel very comfortable in lending to the MSMEs.He was speaking at a webinar on financing the unfinanced organised by the Global Alliance for Mass Entrepreneurship (GAME).There could also be another option of financing based on the cash flow and not on the basis of balance sheet because very often it is observed that the balance sheet and the financial statement are not available in a form which is expected by any banker, he added.Also, there is a broad spectrum of MSMEs in the country which work in a host of areas and often the kind of financial information coming from them is not very organised, Khara explained.So to the extent where the data is fully organised, which is more like any other large corporate, it is the kind of spectrum which SBI is engaging with, he said.""So for different levels of maturity of MSMEs, the comfort level with the bank also differs. If at all they are part of the ecosystem for a large industry major, it becomes all the more easier for the banks to get the information structured vis-a-vis unstructured relating to the (financial) dealings (of the borrower).""And those who are essentially in the nano category, may be say up to Rs 2 crore or so (turnover), there we actually tend to leverage upon various fintechs who are engaging with these MSMEs. So we would rather collaborate with such fintechs and do the co-origination model (of lending),"" Khara said.He further said that SBI is looking at this kind of a spectrum in financing the small businesses.""So this is the kind of spectrum and this is how we actually intend to operate. It may not be out of place to mention that many of the MSMEs are still having lots of business done on cash.""So I think that is posing a major challenge because it is not really giving enough insight into their (financial) behaviour and naturally it is not giving any insight into their turnover,"" said the SBI chairman.He said the country's largest lender will be happy to deal with the intermediary players in the financing business and may be ""we can help such intermediary players by buying out their portfolio also"".The recently launched scheme where banks can also finance some kind of sweat equity is also another option, he added.""So I think we have got the whole gamut of solutions which are available, but all said and done so as the equity is concerned I think that is something, the sweat equity, which is something wanted by the MSMEs to bring in. Of course in the recent past a new scheme has been introduced where we can also finance some kind of sweat equity also, but that is just the beginning,"" Khara said.He said banks need to have enough confidence into various models of the MSMEs and also the commitment level of such entrepreneurs."
SBI,11 Dec 2020,Vijay Mallya applies for funds held by UK court from sale of French property,"Liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya on December 11 made an urgent application before the UK High Court seeking access to millions of pounds to cover his living expenses and legal fees from funds held with the Court Funds Office as part of bankruptcy proceedings, initiated by a consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India.Deputy Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Robert Schaffer declined to allow a draw down from the court-held funds of an estimated amount of around 1.5 million pounds, accrued from the sale of Mallya's French luxury property Le Grand Jardin earlier this year, until further arguments in the case. However, he did allow the release of 240,000 pounds plus VAT to cover the legal costs of a substantive hearing in the bankruptcy proceedings scheduled for next Friday.In essence, I will adjourn this hearing subject to one caveat that the fees for the hearing next week are covered, concluded Judge Schaffer, during a hearing held remotely on Friday. Mallya's counsel, Philip Marshall, had argued that his client needed urgent access to the substantial funds held by the court to cover his living and legal expenses, as had already been set out by a validation order of the High Court from last year.Unless the court grants a validation order, prospectively or retrospectively, any payments made whilst a bankruptcy petition is pending are void. With ongoing proceedings in India and the UK, Dr Mallya cannot wait for something to live on and to cover his legal expenses. With substantial sums outstanding [to lawyers] and no other source of income, it is absurd to refuse, argued Marshall, warning that without the money Mallya would not have any legal representation for the important hearing next week.That would put him at a very serious disadvantage and be a denial of justice, he said. The court heard that 64-year-old Mallya's income from two consultancy agreements was no longer coming in and therefore he had to resort to the money derived from the sale of his French property, which was deposited with the court as a convenient place to put the money.Barrister Marcia Shekerdemian, arguing on behalf of SBI and others in the class action, disputed the grounds of the urgent application as being based on a pre-approved 2019 court validation order. The [2019] order dealt with payments out of his [Mallya's] income. This [application] is referring to payments out of capital assets, which is a very different animal, said Shekerdemian.It is a substantial portion of his admitted UK assets and even on a limited urgency basis, cannot be approved, she said, accusing Mallya of trying to jump the queue to gain access to the funds before the substantive hearing in the bankruptcy case next week. The SBI-led consortium of 13 Indian banks, which also includes Bank of Baroda, Corporation Bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt Ltd, had initiated the proceedings against Mallya in December 2018.There have been a series of hearings in the case since then as part of their efforts to recoup around GBP 1.145 billion in unpaid loans. Mallya, meanwhile, remains on bail as the UK Home Office deals with a confidential legal issue before UK Home Secretary Priti Patel can sign off on his extradition sought by the Indian government, on charges of fraud and money laundering related to loans acquired by his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines."

SBI,03 Dec 2020,"HDFC Bank outage | Working on war footing to strengthen IT infrastructure, will comply with RBI requirements: CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan","After the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) temporarily stopped launch of all new digital products of HDFC Bank, its new CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan on December 3 said the bank will comply with the RBI regulations and will wait for the regulator’s clearance before launching new products.“We had two outages, one in November 2018 and second in December 2019. We have taken help of external expertise, understood what needs to be done further and have substantially implemented the inputs to strengthen our IT infrastructure and systems,” Jagdishan said in a letter to customers.“Unexpectedly another incident happened on November 21,2020, and the primary reason for the same is the power outage in our primary data centre. We are working on war footing to strengthen this area also now,” Jagdishan said.Jagdishan assured customers that there is no reason to worry. “You can continue to transact with the bank without any concern,” he said.Jagdishan apologised for the digital outage to customers. “We realize that as our valued customer, you expect us to maintain a very high standard of service quality and experience. And sometimes, we have not been able to live up to your expectations. For that, please accept our sincere apologies,” the CEO said in the letter.The RBI asked HDFC Bank to temporarily halt sourcing new credit cards and stop the launch of its digital business-generating activities planned under Digital 2.0 and other proposed business generating IT applications.The RBI issued the order dated December 2, 2020, to HDFC Bank.The central bank on November 23 had sought an explanation from HDFC Bank after its digital services faced disruptions on the evening of November 21 till November 22 morning - for over 12 hours.The order also states that HDFC Bank’s board must examine the lapses and fix accountability.“The above measures shall be considered for lifting (the restrictions) upon satisfactory compliance with the major critical observations as identified by the RBI,” it added.New launches after RBI’s clearanceJagdishan said the bank will now launch its digital initiatives after getting the RBI’s approvals.“Some of our strategic digital initiatives to improve the front-end digital experience, improve digital origination, straight through processing, next generation of mobile and internet banking, API-based banking on the edge etc would now be readied and launched post the approval and clearance from the regulator,” the CEO said in the letter.Further, the bank will work with experts and the regulator to fortify the identified areas for improvement. “Internally, we are looking at this as an opportunity to further improve ourselves and emerge stronger,” Jagdishan said.Banks are under immense pressure because of the competition to come up with new digital banking products, often without proper testing and leading to such failures, said senior bankers. “There is intense competition from industry and new players such as payments banks to keep introducing new products. In their anxiety to remain at the top, banks often come with digital banking products that are not fully tested. Banks need to be careful to make sure they have enough technology capabilities to back such products,” said Naresh Malhotra, a senior banking consultant.To be fair, technical glitches aren’t limited to HDFC Bank alone. Other banks too have been facing problems on the technical side, with the latest instance reported on State Bank of India’s (SBI's) mobile banking application, YONO, in the last two days with customers complaining on Twitter that they are unable to login to the application following an error.

Axis Bank,11 Dec 2020,COVID crisis has brought an inflection point in banking system: Axis Bank Chief Amitabh Chaudhary,"The pandemic due to COVID-19 has ushered in an inflection point in the entire banking system which is going to bring in radical changes in terms of lending parameters, MD and CEO of Axis Bank Amitabh Chaudhary said on December 11.Speaking at a session on financial system organised by XLRI, he said that the COVID crisis has created a huge disruption in the banking system in the country where individual banks are feeling its impact. He said that due to the pandemic, individuals ability to repay loans has reduced significantly while 90 percent of the banks' books is in moratorium.""The crisis has increased the health costs and the average individual household needs money while banks at the same time will have to be more cautious. A vicious negative cycle has set in while discretionary spending has hit an all time low"", Chaudhary said.At Axis, he said the bank has been able to raise capital to provide comfort to the depositors while the provision coverage ratio has gone up from 70 per cent to 124 per cent. Chaudhary said that the bank had also been modernising its monitoring aspects leading to fall in GNPA and NNPA levels.According to him, the banking system will have to opt for more granular mode using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) which will form the basis of lending decisions.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Chaudhary also said that data points like credit card payments and salary pay-outs will also be used for taking a lending decision. This, he said, will be supplemented by robust underwriting, also determine the long-term survival potential of the sectors and also look at the history of the promoters who are seeking loans.Chaudhary said Axis bank had activated its quick response team before the crisis surfaced in India looking at the experience of China.He also said that for the first time, stress is building up in the retail sector putting the banks in a precarious situation which will have an impact on the price of loans and interest rates."

Axis Bank,05 Nov 2020,Buy Axis Bank; target of Rs 620: Emkay Global Financial,"Emkay Global Financial's report on Axis BankAxis reported a PAT of Rs16.8bn (vs. estimated Rs14.6bn) mainly due to better NIMs and contained opex, partly offset by the continued strengthening of contingent provisioning buffer - now at 1.9% of loans (one of the highest among large peers). Overall loan growth was moderate at 11% yoy, including retail growth at 12% yoy/2% qoq. Though the bank has not given any numerical guidance, it expects overall growth trajectory to improve, led by retail and corporate growth largely in better-rated corporates.

Axis Bank,04 Nov 2020,Buy Axis Bank; target of Rs 600: ICICI Direct,"ICICI Direct's research report on Axis BankIn Q2FY21, Axis Bank reported net interest income (NII) growth of 20% YoY to Rs 7326 crore. Strong NII growth was driven by expansion in net interest margin (NIM), which jumped 7 bps YoY, 18 bps QoQ to 3.58%. Sequential 18 bps expansion in NIM was due to 3 bps from capital raise, 5 bps from lower interest reversals and 10 bps from better liquidity management. From Q1FY21, the bank is adding some amount in NII reserve. As a result, NIM was negatively impacted by 5 bps. Other income for the quarter increased 47% sequentially to Rs 3807 crore, which was on account of 67% QoQ rise in the fee income (insurance distribution surged). Cost to income ratio declined 90 bps QoQ to 38.0%. Part of this can be attributed to relatively lower business volumes as a result of less cost. PAT for the quarter increased 51.3% QoQ to Rs 1683 crore compared to a loss of Rs 112 crore.OutlookThe management held its guidance to remain well above industry credit growth, though it is currently cautious on certain segments. It can see minimal loans going for restructuring (estimated 1.6% of loans). Strong capital position, healthy operating metrics and reasonable prudence in provisioning provides comfort for steady earnings visibility and return ratios reaching 0.9% RoA and ~9% RoE by FY22. We value the bank at 1.6x FY22E ABV to arrive at a revised TP of Rs 600 (from Rs 530).

Infosys,26 Nov 2020,Can IT services firms gain from the massive Covid-19 vaccine rollout?,"Bengaluru-based IT major Infosys last week launched a solution for Covid-19 vaccine management. Earlier, US-based Accenture, too, had launched a similar solution to support vaccination programmes and vaccine-distribution activities.So, what have IT services firms to gain from the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines? Quite a bit. The world is staring at a vaccination drive for billions of people. Many countries, including India, are allocating budgets and drawing up plans to make this rollout as smooth as possible.All these are being done on a scale never seen before and in a very short time. This presents a huge business opportunity not just for biotech firms, pharmaceuticals or logistics players but also for tech firms.Where does the opportunity lie?The opportunities for tech firms are in two key areas: patient management and cold chain monitoring.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Karthikeyan Natarajan, COO of Hyderabad-based IT Services firm Cyient, has some insights on the potential. Cyient is looking to tap into opportunities in vaccine management, such as cold chain monitoring.Natarajan explained that the job is not done just about administration of vaccines. “Say (for instance) 10 million vaccines are administered in Hyderabad or Mumbai. How do you really know that it has gone well and it has not reacted,” he asked.Follow Moneycontrol's COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker here.“So, it is not so much about saying that I am done with the injection; if you are a vaccine producer, you have to map the whole lifecycle,” he added.“You need to use a lot of digital tools from a patient-management standpoint before administration, during and post,” he added.Managing cold chainsPatient management is just one aspect. The other is managing cold chains. Pfizer’s vaccine, which has shown more than 95 percent efficacy in phase-3 trials, needs to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius. Moderna’s vaccine would need -20 degrees Celsius storage and AstraZeneca needs to be refrigerated at 2-8 degrees.These cold-storage chains need to be managed. For instance, it would be important to monitor how soon these vaccines need to be administered and also check for spoilage. According to a Scientific American report, once Pfizer’s vaccine is transferred to a refrigerator, it has to be administered within five days. Also, during distribution, there could be chances of vaccines being spoilt. According to the report, this spoilage could be anywhere between 5-20 percent.The Internet of things can be used to monitor the temperature and keep a check on vaccine vials “so that you know which ones got exposed to higher temperatures for a longer duration and segregate them”, he explained.The scale at which this needs to be managed is huge and would require technological intervention, where tech services firms come into play.Role of tech services in vaccine managementA case in point is the announcement by the Australian State of Victoria, which recently announced a tender for a Covid-19 vaccine management solution. The State said it is looking to select a private contractor who can deliver cloud-based software to manage the entire process of the vaccine rollout.Infosys and Accenture have jumped into the fray to develop solutions.Infosys’ vaccine management solution, developed by Simplus (which it acquired recently), and hosted on the Salesforce cloud, offers solutions for individuals and healthcare service providers. While individuals can use the platform to find solutions and schedule appointments, providers can use it to maintain inventory, log vaccine administration details and document adverse effects.Accenture’s solution, built on the Salesforce platform, includes contract tracing and managing the supply chain. It uses analytics to allocate vaccine supply and also monitor the dosage regime.How big an opportunity is there?There is a lot riding for firms involved in the vaccine drive. The cost of slipups is huge and their reputation could take a massive hit, pointed out analysts, explaining why the role tech service providers play would be important. However, the opportunity is tough to quantify, as vaccine management alone would not result in substantial revenue, say analysts and executives.Pareekh Jain, founder, Pareekh Consulting, agreed that the vaccine drive is unlikely to bring in substantial revenue for IT services firms. But, he added, it allows companies to expand their footprint into healthcare.Jain explained that so far, IT firms; exposure to core pharmaceutical operations is small as they use their in-house team. However the sheer scale of operations amid Covid-19 can give them an entry point to move beyond legacy operations by leveraging their data analytics and AI solutions to gain a bigger market, he added.In the wake of Covid-19, healthcare was one of the few sectors that grew for IT services firms. The last six months saw huge investments coming into pharmaceuticals, medical devices and predictive healthcare, some of which are likely to stay. This could also provide more opportunities."
Infosys,18 Nov 2020,"COVID-19 vaccine should be offered free of cost to everyone, says Narayana Murthy","Amid positive news regarding COVID-19 vaccine development from companies such as Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, Infosys co-founder NR Narayana Murthy has said that a shot, when it becomes available, should be provided free of cost to all.""I believe (Covid-19 vaccine) should be a public good and everybody should be vaccinated free. These vaccines should be free for the entire population on the planet,"" Murthy told The Economic Times in an interview.Also Read | Storage of Pfizer's COVID vaccine challenge for most nations; India examining possibilities: Govt""All vaccine-producing companies should be compensated by the UN or the individual countries for their cost and not for huge profits,"" Murthy added.Several state governments in India, including Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, have promised to provide free vaccine to its people when it becomes available.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection.

Infosys,15 Nov 2020,"We are close to 63% visa-independent in US; over 50% in Europe, Australia-New Zealand: Infosys","Infosys has been ""intensely focused"" on skilling and generating local employment in markets like the US, which has helped the IT services major become about 63 percent visa-independent in the US and over 50 percent in Europe and Australia-New Zealand, a top company executive said.Infosys, which counts the US as its biggest market, said it is still early to comment on the approach the new US administration could take towards work visas but it expects to continue benefiting from its ongoing localisation efforts.""We continue to see challenges to mobility of talent. New proposed immigration regulations in USA could impact onsite wage costs, granting of visas, tenure of visas, and overall costs of compliance.""Our localisation programme across USA, Europe and Australia, launched three years ago, mitigates many of these,"" Infosys Chief Operating Officer Pravin Rao said at a recent analyst meet.He added that Infosys has eight innovation hubs across the US and the EU, nine global Digital Studios (including a 5G lab in Melbourne) and seven global cyber defense centres.""We are close to 63 percent visa-independent in the US and over 50 percent in Europe and ANZ. We have been intensely focused on creating jobs in the US for the past three years,"" he noted.In September, the Bengaluru-based firm had said it plans to hire 12,000 American workers over the next two years, taking its hiring commitment in the country to 25,000 over five years.Industry watchers say while IT companies have been ramping up their presence in the US and other markets, and hiring locals over the past few years to overcome visa-related challenges.North America is the largest market for Infosys, accounting for 60.7 percent of its revenue, followed by Europe (24.3 percent), rest of the world (12 percent) and India (3 percent), as on September 30, 2020. Infosys had clocked 8.5 percent year-on-year rise in revenue to Rs 24,570 crore in the September 2020 quarter.Infosys had 2,40,208 employees at the end of the said quarter. It does not provide a region-specific break-up of the headcount.Rao said that through academia partnerships with institutes like Purdue, Trinity and RISD, the company has trained a large number of employees as well, and is leveraging the training and reskilling programmes that it has built with partners.""We recently launched reskill and restart platform, which will play a crucial role in hiring local talent. We will bring a specific focus on building pathways for those that have been impacted by the economic downturn,"" he said adding that Infosys is also expanding its presence in nearshore locations like Mexico and Canada.Asked if Infosys will rethink its strategy as the approach of the president-elect on the visa issue appears to be more liberal, Rao said it is still early days to comment.""It is early days to see what the approach of the new regime is towards visa and by and large many of the things we saw during the Trump regime had bipartisan support as well.""We may see some changes from the Trump regime, but it will not go back to the old pre-Trump days,"" he added.He added that from a strategic perspective, Infosys'' approach of localisation is ""probably the right one"".""This is what we anticipated about three years back and we are seeing huge success and we have benefited from it and it is likely to continue,"" Rao said.Indian IT players are keeping a close watch on US president-elect Joe Biden''s approach and policies related to H-1B work visas that are used by a large number of Indian technology professionals. Biden is to be sworn in as the US president on January 20, 2021.In June, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Donald Trump administration had banned the entry into the US of workers in several key non-immigrant visa categories, including H-1B, until the end of the year, arguing that they eat into American jobs.Those affected include the family members of the H-1B, L-1, and certain categories of J1 visas. Later, certain exemptions in H-1B and L-1 travel bans were announced for those continuing employment with the same employer. The move that could help Indian IT professionals and those working in the healthcare sector."

Revenue grew 6.1% QoQ to $3.3bn. EBITM expanded 270bps to 25.3% (highest quarterly margin since Q4FY16). Strong operating performance led to a net profit beat. For FY21, Infosys raised its revenue guidance to 2-3% YoY cc (from 0-2%) and EBIT margins range to 23-24% (from 21-23%). Its full-year outlook implies a 0.5-1.7% CQGR over the remaining two quarters.

Infosys,15 Oct 2020,Buy Infosys; target of Rs 1355: Motilal Oswal,"Motilal Oswal 's research report on InfosysInfosys (INFO)’s 2QFY21 revenue and margin performance were above expectations. The company impressed with a second consecutive quarter of strong margin expansion (270bp QoQ in 2Q; ~420bp over 1HFY21). We expect some margin benefits to be sustainable (driven by automation, etc.). On the other hand, tailwinds (such as increased offshoring, lower attrition, deferred wage hikes, and lower travel/SGA costs) as a result of the pandemic are likely to partly wane out later on as the situation normalizes further over the next few quarters. The highest ever deal wins were reported (~USD3.15b), and the deal pipeline remains healthy. Upward revision to FY21 guidance – with revenue growth of 2–3% YoY CC (v/s 0–2% earlier) and margin guidance of 23–24% (v/s 21–23% earlier) – is positive, but still conservative. We expect Infosys to deliver above guidance in FY21 a) notwithstanding margin headwinds (wage hikes in 4Q, large deal ramp-up, seasonality, above margin factors, etc.) and b) based on strong deal wins. We upgrade our FY21/FY22E EPS estimates by 9%/12% as we adjust our revenue and EBIT margin trajectory. Infosys should be a key beneficiary in terms of recovery in IT spends in FY22. Additionally, leading operational performance in 1HFY21, coupled with strong deal wins, should translate to strong outperformance on EPS growth (v/s the sector). Reiterate Buy.OutlookAs Infosys has outperformed TCS in 1HFY21 and is on its way to an industry-leading performance in FY21 (amongst Tier I), we expect the divergence in the valuation to narrow (to 10%).

The company witnessed strong loan growth performance, improved granularity of deposits and its growth, and expanded RoA led by strong fee income growth. On the other hand, asset quality weakened slightly with high net slippages (excl. lumpy accounts) ratio (+30bp YoY to 2.07%) and increase in write-offs (+70bp YoY to 1.7%). GNPL / PCR remained stable at 1.6%/60% YoY. BAF delivered healthy NII/PPoP/PAT growth of 39%/46%/32% in the year. Credit cost increased from 1.6% to 3.1% due to Covid-19 related provisions (2.5% ex-COVID related provisions) and write-offs of some large accounts. On the business front, BAF saw sharp moderation in new customer addition of +6% YoY to 8.7m, which is concerning. Overall, number of loans distributed declined from 50% YoY levels over the past three fiscals to 17% YoY in FY20. Customer base growth slowed down from 30% YoY levels earlier to 24% in FY20. Cross-selling for new origination increased from 65% in FY19 to ~70% in FY20. BAF has done well on two fronts - deposits and fee income. Deposit growth was in line with prior years at 60%+. Importantly, granular public deposit base grew 90%+ YoY with near doubling of depositors to 362k. Fee income grew 54% YoY to INR26b, driven by all categories, especially distribution income. Fees to assets improved to 2.0% from 1.7% in FY19 and 1.1% in FY18, driving RoA expansion. In line with current macros and the evolving pandemic situation, we expect share of rural business (9% of AUM) to rise sharply in FY21. A high share of BAF's business comes from metro cities; post the initial pent-up demand, we are yet to see signs of growth sustaining.

ITC,08 Nov 2020,ITC's 20% drop in Q2 net could be masking a strategic shift in its FMCG business,"Diversified business conglomerate ITC's nearly 20 percent drop in profits in second quarter-ended September 30, 2020 may well be masking a strategic shift towards consistently strengthening its fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) business, a segment that has otherwise remained largely ignored among investors and analysts.The company's net profit during the quarter fell to Rs 3,232.4 crore during the quarter, compared to Rs 4,023.1 crore in the same period last year, meeting street estimates.Revenue from the FMCG and 'Others' segment, however, clocked a 18.4 percent growth on a comparable basis (excluding lifestyle retailing business for which restructuring is underway, as also the education and stationery products business that has been seriously impacted by the closure of educational institutions).A disaggregated analysis points towards a strategic tilt towards FMCG in recent years.In the current financial year during the quarter-ended September 30, 2020, EBITDA for the FMCG segment grew 66 percent, while EBITDA margins for the segment expanded 300 basis points to 9.7 percent.In the first half of the year, it launched over 70 new products in what appears to be part of an ambitious expansion plan identifying the FMCG segment as the company's main growth driver, with focus on new products, bold acquisitions and the high-octane marketing.In May, it announced the decision to acquire Kolkata-based spice maker Sunrise Foods Pvt. Ltd (SFPL), seen as part of a wider strategy to fortify its position in the country's highly competitive FMCG market that is dominated by large corporations such as Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) and several local players in diverse regional geographies.The earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortisation (EBITDA) of the new FMCG businesses has more than doubled in three years— growing from from Rs 456 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 914 crores in 2019-20.Over an eight-year period, segment EBIDTA for the FMCG businesses has multiplied from Rs 44 crore in 2012-13, a year before current Chairman Sanjiv Puri was elevated to president of the company’s FMCG business, to Rs 914 crore in 2019-20, galloping at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 54 percent.These may well be pointers for analysts and investors on what could be coming, particularly in the foods business with brands such as Aashirvaad (Rs 6,000 crore), Sunfeast (Rs 4,000 crore), Bingo (Rs 2,700 crore) and YiPPee (Rs 1,300 crore), achieving significant value and scale.The restructuring of the lifestyle retailing business with the sale of the John Players brand are all measures to improve profitability of the FMCG segment.There also appears to be a tactical shift in marketing initiatives with considerable focus on engagements with properties such as IPL, fitness and hygiene through Sunfeast, Bingo and Savlon."

However, EBITDA and PAT were disappointing due to (a) estimated 37% cigarette volume decline, (b) far lower contribution of the highly profitable cigarette business to total sales (32% in 1QFY21 v/s usual levels of ~40%), and (c) massive losses in the hospitality business (~8% negative impact on EBITDA in 1QFY21 v/s 1% usual positive contribution). Our channel checks indicate that cigarette volumes are close to pre-COVID levels. However, re-imposition of lockdowns in a few states could have some negative effect. Nevertheless, it is unlikely for the (a) weak mix in 1QFY21 (low cigarette proportion to total sales) to be repeated, and (b) impact on margins to be as sharp as in 1QFY21.OutlookFurther, outlook for the hotel business is still extremely hazy, which should lead to some profitability impact.

ITC,28 Jul 2020,Buy ITC; target of Rs 225: ICICI Direct,"ICICI Direct's research report on ITCITC reported 17.4% decline in sales with cigarettes revenues seeing de-growth of 29.1%. The volume dip of 40% was better than our expectation given 45 days business loss. We believe trade (distributor, retailers) inventory would have depleted during lockdown despite retail shops staying closed. Preferred pack buying over loose cigarettes also helped restore volumes. These factors would have helped company to re-fill trade pipeline given manufacturing & supply chain operations normalised in June. The trade normally holds 14 days inventory. Comparable FMCG sales grew 12.2% with strong demand in staples, packages foods & hygiene product and steep decline in discretionary & stationary businesses. Operating margins contracted 1184 bps mainly impacted by negative operating leverage & excise hike earlier in budget.

The cigarette business posted ~29% YoY de-growth, vs our estimate of 25% decline. A 970bps decline in margin in the cigarette business indicates that the product mix was unfavorable and economy brand contribution must have increased during the quarter. Significant increase in duty has resulted in widening of price gap between ITC and smuggled cigarettes. We believe that this would continue to pressurize volume growth even after lockdown re-opens.

Kotak Mahindra,23 Nov 2020,Top 12 stocks to look at from banking & financial space after RBI panel recommendations,"The Reserve Bank of India's internal working group has proposed several recommendations to revive the Indian private banking sector in a big way.These recommendations are largely related to ownership guidelines and corporate structure of Indian private sector banks. And if these recommendations get implemented properly, then experts believe the market share of private banks could increase significantly in the coming years, but they feel the implementation may take more time.Also, there could be a reduction in intermediation cost and it could make the banking system more efficient going ahead, according to experts.The key suggestions by the panel are to raise promoters' cap to 26 percent from current 15 percent in 15-year period and to allow large corporate houses as promoters of banks or take significant stake in banks. For non-promoter shareholding, the uniform cap of 15 percent can be for all shareholders.Other recommendations are NBFCs with more than Rs 50,000 crore asset can be converted into banks after 10 years, three-year track record must be enough for payments bank to be converted into small finance bank, minimum cap for licensing universal banks must be raised to Rs 1,000 crore from Rs 500 crore and minimum cap for licensing small finance banks should be raised to Rs 300 crore from Rs 200 crore etc.""We view the RBI's panel report related to the ownership of private sector banks as progressive in nature. Suggestions for corporate/industrial houses on how to get a banking license, and allowing NBFCs (even belonging to industrial houses) above asset sizes of Rs 50,000 crore to get banking licenses would increase healthy competition, making the banking system more efficient, reducing intermediation cost, and ultimately increasing credit penetration in the system,"" Motilal Oswal said.Largely there are 12 stocks which could be biggest beneficiaries if these recommendations get implemented properly in coming years, including Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank, Equitas Small Finance Bank, Ujjivan Small Finance Bank, Bajaj Finance, M&M Finance, Shriram Transport, L&T Finance Holdings, AU Small Finance Bank, Bandhan Bank and DCB Bank.IDFC First Bank is also expected to be benefit if it sells the mutual fund business, experts feel.Over the last five years, private sector banks have rapidly gained market share to around 30 percent (2020) from around 18 percent (2015).Motilal Oswal sees this trend accelerating at a faster pace now and feels M&A opportunities may also increase in the system as corporates with deep pockets may adopt this route rather than building from scratch.The RBI had constituted an internal working group on June 12 to review extant ownership guidelines and corporate structure of Indian private sector banks. Terms of reference included review of the eligibility criteria for individuals/entities to apply for banking license; examination of preferred corporate structure for banks and, review of norms for long-term shareholding in banks by promoters and other shareholders.""These steps are in right direction and beneficial for the sector in the long-term but we believe these measures have played out in the recent price rally,"" ICICI Direct said.The Nifty Bank index gained just 41 percent till October month from March 23's low, whereas Nifty50 and Metal itself gained 53 percent each, IT rallied 87 percent and Pharma 75 percent.But in November, the main leader was banking sector. Nifty Bank added more than 30 percent in current month, taking the total gains of itself to over 70 percent from March lows and taking the Nifty50's gains, too, to over 70 percent from March lows.The recent rally was also led by the banking sector Q2FY21 result. Key points which favoured expansion in valuation are (a) Improvement in collection efficiency, the majority of the banks have reported more than 90 percent collection efficiency; (b) Improvement in NIM, led by a contraction in excess liquidity and positive impact of capital raise; and (c) Improvement in asset quality owing to standstill benefit given on asset classification, said Jaikishan Parmar, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Angel Broking.There are some recommendations with respect to Non-Operative Financial Holding Company (NOFHC) structure by the RBI panel.The IWG recommends that NOFHCs should continue to be the preferred structure for all new ‘Universal Banks’. Further, banks currently under the NOFHC structure, which do not have other group entities within their fold could be permitted to exit said structure.HDFC Securities believes that the IWG recommendations, in their current shape, are vague on whether the NOFHC structure applies to small finance banks (SFBs) - in case this eventually applies to SFBs, Ujjivan Small Finance Bank and Equitas Small Finance Bank will be positively impacted."

Including standstill NPAs, slippages would have been ~1.1% and gross NPA would be stable QoQ at 2.7%. PCR increased by ~700 bps QoQ to 76% and stood at ~72% on a pro forma basis, implying healthy recoveries and low write-offs during the quarter. Standard loan cover stood at 0.6% of advances as of Sep-end, same as last quarter. Management noted that the stock of provisions the bank held was adequate and conservative.

Maruti Suzuki,09 Dec 2020,Why India’s top 5 carmakers control 85% of the passenger vehicle market,"India’s top five carmakers have tightened their stranglehold over the passenger vehicle (PV) market, expanding their footprint to cover 85 percent of the pie, leaving 22 other brands jostling for a slice of the remaining 15 percent.Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Tata Motors, Kia Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra dominate the PV segment despite the presence of large, recognised global brands such as Renault, Ford, Honda, Toyota and Volkswagen.Data shared by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA) show that the top five companies improved their share this year by 4.5 percentage points till November from the 81.56 percent clocked by them in November last year.For a large market (India is the fourth largest automotive market in the world) such a lack of fragmentation in the market share is unique. For instance, in China, which is the world’s largest automotive market, the top five carmakers control only 40 percent of the market and in the US, their share stands at 68 percent. As for Germany, which was overtaken by India last year, the top five carmakers commanded a 50 percent share.Japan remains an exception to the list with nearly 81 percent of the market controlled by the top five companies, all of which are Japanese brands. Toyota, a dominant brand in many countries, has a share of just 3 percent in India.New launches and brand loyalty helped India’s top five carmakers to improve their market share. Though Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest carmaker, did not have any new model launches during the year so far, the company still managed to improve its retail share.How they faredA senior Maruti official said the company increased its market share to more than 50 percent in November from the 45 percent recorded in November last year. “Maruti’s low-cost models, strong brand recall and wider network helped it gain market share during the last few months. People tend to fall back on tried and tested brands during trying times,” said a senior Mumbai-based analyst.Hyundai recorded a slight decline in retail market share to 16.21 percent in November from the 17.74 percent clocked in November 2019. Tata Motors recorded the second biggest rise in retail market share in November to 7.5 percent, from 4.84 percent, while Kia Motors logged the best improvement in share to 6.28 percent from 3.78 percent.Tata Motors’ pre-lockdown launch Altroz and SUV Nexon helped it improve its share. As for Kia Motors, the compact SUV Sonet, which has gone on to become the best-seller in its segment, helped it widen market share.Tata Motors reclaimed the third spot a few months ago — Kia had raced to number three in March but is currently in the fourth spot.Mahindra & Mahindra, India’s fifth largest PV maker, suffered the worst fall in November in its peer group. From 6.78 percent, M&M’s market share in the retail PV space fell to 5.48 percent during the month."

Maruti Suzuki,08 Dec 2020,"Recovery in full speed: Cars, SUVs record best-ever November sales","After a fall in October, sales of cars and SUVs have swung back in the green - registering their best-ever numbers for November, following an upbeat demand during the Diwali period.Retail sales of passenger vehicles (car, SUV and vans) for November stood at 291,001 units, as per data shared by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA), registering a growth of 4 percent compared to November 2019.Retail sales, which are bought by the final customer, are the real barometer of market demand as they represent the actual vehicle registration done by the regional transport offices (RTOs).Pan-India retail volumes are estimated to be slightly above 330,000 units November, as per Maruti Suzuki India. Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Lakhshadweep which make up 15-20 percent of the retail volumes are not part of the central government’s Vahan portal from where FADA sources the retail volumes.FADA also shared retail volumes for the entire 42-day festive period which started with Navratri in October and ended with Diwali in November. The industry saw a 14 percent increase in retail volumes to 431,597 units as against the same 42-day period last year.New launches such as Kia Sonet, Mahindra Thar, Hyundai i20, Toyota Urban Cruiser provided the boost to retail sales.Vinkesh Gulati, president, FADA said, “Automobile industry has seen one of the best recovery rates since unlocking began as November saw positive momentum. New launches especially in the compact SUV segment continued to show good demand in the PV segment.”Two-wheeler retail sales remained in the red in November like each of the previous months. The segment registered a 21 percent decline in volumes to 1.41 million units during November compared to the same month in 2019. In contrast, wholesales grew by 13 percent to 1.59 million units during the same month.The two-wheeler segment posted a drop in volumes during the 42-day festive period too. The category saw 6 percent decline in volumes to 1.9 million units during November as against the same month last year.While for the PV segment inventory days continue to be very low at 25-30 days (usual is 35-40 days) for the two-wheeler segment the inventory days were higher at 45-50 days (usual is 35-45 days)."
Maruti Suzuki,07 Dec 2020,Why did Maruti Suzuki sales fall in November 2020?,"Maruti Suzuki became the only carmaker in the top five category to register a drop in sales in November 2020. This came on the back of two consecutive months of robust double-digit growths. Sales of the Alto and Swift maker fell by 2.4 percent during November while the industry grew by 9 percent during the same month.So was it demand fatigue, fierce competition or a combination of both behind the fall, which has spooked market watchers? None, as per a company official. The real reason behind the fall was due to the record low factory inventory and production shortages.Speaking to Moneycontrol, Shashank Srivastava, executive director, marketing and sales, Maruti Suzuki India, said: “In November, our opening stock was very low. There was very little of it because we had record dispatches in October.”In October 2020, Maruti Suzuki dispatched around 166,000 units, which was its highest-ever in a month. But in November, the company recorded dispatches of 135,775 units as against 139,133 units recorded in the same month in 2019.“What we could dispatch in November was only what we were able to produce in November. The number of working days in our factories in November were much lesser. Still, we worked at full capacity, and produced 137,000 units for the domestic market (including the light truck Super Carry) and that’s what we dispatched,” added Srivastava. Supply chain (auto parts availability) is still an issue in the auto industry. Plus, Diwali holidays also hit factory output.Maruti's drop in November sales was the first since June, fuelling speculations that India’s consumer demand revival was short-lived and largely dependent on pent-up demand created due to the lockdown. This theory was amplified when Maruti’s mini segment comprising Alto and S-Presso recorded a fall of 15 percent in volumes during November. Following the easing of the lockdown restrictions, buyers have preferred pocket-friendly car models such as those from the mini segment to avoid taking public transport.The retail quotientWhile wholesales (company to dealers) did take a knock in November, retail (dealer to consumer) volumes remained upbeat, growing by 69 percent compared to the same month last year, claimed Srivastava.“Maruti Suzuki’s market share in the retail segment is still more than 50 percent and it has remained like that, right from the start of the year. It was 45 percent in November last year. We grew our retails by 69 percent compared to last year’s November. We sold 167,500 in November this year compared to 99,500 last year,” added Srivastava.Retail volumes remained high in November despite the discounts hitting a yearly low. At an estimated Rs 17,500, the average discount offered on a Maruti Suzuki car during November was the lowest since the start of the financial year. The highest discount was offered during the June quarter of Rs 25,000 per car at the wholesale level.“As the stocks are lower right now, one would see lower discount figures in December as it was in November. December would be even lower than November,” added Srivastava.How did Maruti’s rivals fare?Hyundai Motor India, which, like Maruti Suzuki, is also running its plants at full capacity, recorded a 9 percent growth in wholesale volumes in November. Tata Motors managed to keep up with its monthly production rate of November on par with the last few months. The Mumbai-based company doubled November wholesales compared to last year’s November."
Maruti Suzuki,05 Dec 2020,"Maruti Suzuki's production in November up 6% at 1,50,221 units","The country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India on December 5 said its total production in November increased 5.91 percent to 1,50,221 units.The company had produced total 1,41,834 units in the same month last year, Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) said in a regulatory filing. Passenger vehicles production stood at 1,46,577 units last month as compared with 1,39,084 units in November 2019, a growth of 5.38 percent.Production of mini cars comprising Alto and S-Presso models stood marginally up at 24,336 units last month as against 24,052 units in the year-ago period.Similarly, manufacturing of compact cars, comprising WagonR, Celerio, Ignis, Swift, Baleno, Dzire, stood at 85,118 units as against 78,133 units in November 2019, an increase of 8.93 percent, MSI said."
Maruti Suzuki,03 Dec 2020,Toyota not to manufacture Suzuki Brezza at India plants,"Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL) on December 3 informed that the Suzuki Brezza will not be manufactured by Toyota at its Bengaluru plant in 2022.  Another unidentified model will be produced in its place, the car market leader said.This change brings curtains on the agreement that allowed Maruti to source the Brezza from Toyota. In March 2019, the board of Maruti Suzuki cleared proposals to partly source the Brezza compact sports utility vehicle (SUV) from Toyota Kirloskar Motors (TKM) as a part of the broader non-equity based agreement signed between Suzuki and Toyota in February 2017.The change comes barely 20 months after Toyota and Suzuki agreed to share models as part of the broader international agreement between the two companies. Toyota sources the Brezza from Maruti Suzuki but not before it is rebadged, marketed and sold as Urban Cruiser from its own showrooms.“Vide our letter dated March 27, 2019, we had informed you about the decision of the Board to manufacture Vitara Brezza at the existing plant of Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) starting year 2022. The Board has, today, approved to change the model to be manufactured at TKM from Vitara Brezza to another model,” said MSIL in a statement sent to the BSE.Brezza is the second model supplied by Suzuki to Toyota in India with the first being the Maruti Suzuki Baleno which is rebadged as Toyota Glanza. The Urban Cruiser was launched by Toyota in early October in India being priced higher than the Maruti Brezza.MSIL declined to comment when approached for further clarity on the matter including the reason behind the sudden change. The copy will be updated with TKM’s comments as soon as they are shared.Last year, Suzuki even dabbled with the idea of moving the entire production of the Brezza to Toyota plants. This would have allowed MSIL to free up capacity at its Haryana plant which also makes the Urban Cruiser.Following the launch of Kia Sonet and Hyundai Venue, Maruti’s share in the compact SUV segment has recorded a slide. From being the largest SUV maker in India MSIL’s position in the compact SUV segment has come down to the third spot."
Maruti Suzuki,02 Dec 2020,November auto sales show YoY rise in volume; brokerages name 8 stocks to look at,"On expected lines, most automakers witnessed a rise in monthly volume on a year-on-year (YoY) basis for the month of November even though volume declined on a month-on-month basis.As the festival period is over, it was expected that the demand will ease on monthly basis.A significant pick-up in demand was seen for commercial vehicles (CV) while passenger vehicles (PV), two-wheelers (2W) and tractors also did well.Ashutosh Tiwari, Head of Research at Equirus Securities pointed out there was an element of pent-up demand as sales were lower in Q1FY21, but the shift towards personal mobility was also a reason behind demand pick up.""Sales also benefited from increased savings of service class and government employees as there were limited avenues for spending since the COVID outbreak. Lower finance cost is also helping demand,"" Tiwari said.As the economy is improving and the vaccine for COVID-19 looks near, is the road for automakers going to be smooth now?Brokerages and analysts expect volumes to improve in the coming quarters on strong rural sentiment, low-interest rates, improving finance availability and a gradual pick-up in the business and economic activity.""We believe that post the festive season, the inventory for passenger car OEMs is below the average 30-day levels, which has led to the growth. Over the rest of the year, we expect sales trends to be better than what was earlier expected as the economy is gradually normalising,"" said Aditya Makharia, Institutional Research Analyst (Auto), HDFC Securities.However, the road for all segments is not going to be the same.""Festive season sales were reasonable, with no major negative surprise. Current demand and low inventory sentiment in PV and tractor suggest higher wholesales in the coming months. On the flip side, 2W and CV OEMs are expected to maintain a cautious stance, with no major inventory push,"" said brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services.""Valuations reflect for recovery to sustain in the coming quarters, leaving a limited margin for safety for any negative surprises. Hence, we prefer companies with: a) higher visibility in terms of demand recovery, b) a strong competitive positioning, c) margin drivers, and d) balance sheet strength,"" Motilal Oswal added.Tiwari of Equirus Securities believes there is likely to be a sluggish period over the next 2-3 months due to seasonal weakness post festivals, but he expects demand to pick up again from March-April 2021 as rural demand will pick up post-harvest and with COVID cases subsiding even earnings of business class people will revive.Brokerage firm ICICI Securities pointed out that the rising incentive schemes across segments post-festive season, lack of price increase even in wake of higher input costs correlate with the fragility of the consumer sentiment.""We believe channel inventory clearance remains a key priority for December; thus, expect incentives to increase further by the end of Q3,"" ICICI Securities said.Pankaj Bobade, Head - Fundamental Research, Axis Securities is of the view with the festive season now over in India, the auto industry volumes to moderate in Q4FY21 as the pent-up demand is tapering down and fresh demand has to kick in to sustain the growth.""Generally, the December month witnesses tepid growth at the retail level, as the end-users await the vehicle with chassis plate of the new year. Hence, the short-term (2 months) outlook would be relatively soft compared to the festive season but we expect the auto industry to post a strong double-digit recovery over FY22 and FY23 on the back of improving fundamentals, a low base of FY20 and FY21 and recovery in the other sectors of the economy,"" Bobade said.Rusmik Oza, Executive Vice President and Head of Fundamental Research-PCG at Kotak Securities has a cautious view on the automobile sector as stock prices have rallied smartly on the back of better results and healthy volume growth.""We expect net profits of the automobiles sector to increase 11 percent in FY21 despite very low volumes in Q1FY21 (affected by the nation-wide lockdown in the months of April and May 2020),"" Oza said.For the medium-term, Oza expects the motorcycle industry to grow at 12-20 percent in FY22-23 after a sharp decline in FY21. He expects the domestic car industry to grow by 14-22 percent during FY22-23E after a sharp decline in FY21.""We expect a moderate decline in FY21E EBITDA margins of the OEMs given lower volumes that will result in negative operating leverage and higher costs related to the implementation of new fuel emission standards (BS-VI fuel standards applicable from April 1, 2020. We expect EBITDA margin to improve in FY22 on the back of higher volumes (positive operating leverage),"" Oza said.Mitul Shah, Head of Research at Reliance Securities believes that demand for automobiles would remain healthy over the medium to long-term, though the pace of growth may taper down.""We may see some slowdown over near-term due to post-festival effect, while FY22 would be strong for the sector with healthy double-digit growth,"" Shah said.Stocks to focusGlobal financial firm Morgan Stanley expects all segments of the auto sector to recover sharply in 2021.It expects growth to taper off in Q3 and rebound sharply in Q4.""Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Auto & Eicher Motors remain our preferred overweights.

Maruti Suzuki,01 Dec 2020,"Maruti Suzuki sales increase 1.7% to 1,53,223 units in November","The country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) on Tuesday reported a 1.7 percent increase in sales to 1,53,223 units in November.The company had sold 1,50,630 units in November last year, Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) said in a statement.Domestic sales increased marginally to 1,44,219 units last month as against 1,43,686 units in November 2019, it added.Sales of mini cars, comprising Alto and S-Presso, declined by 15.1 percent to 22,339 units as compared to 26,306 in the same month last year.Similarly, sales of compact segment, including models such as Swift, Celerio, Ignis, Baleno and Dzire, declined by 1.8 percent to 76,630 units as against 78,013 cars in November last year.Sales of mid-sized sedan Ciaz, however, increased by 29.1 percent to 1,870 units as compared with 1,448 in November 2019.Similarly, utility vehicle sales, including Vitara Brezza, S-Cross and Ertiga, rose 2.4 percent to 23,753 units compared to 23,204 in the year-ago month, MSI said."
Maruti Suzuki,27 Nov 2020,"Should car companies follow Indian standards for crash tests or those of pvt agencies, asks Maruti Suzuki Chairman RC Bhargava","Maruti Suzuki Chairman RC Bhargava has asked whether car companies should follow the norms prescribed by the government or some private agency when it comes to crash tests.Speaking to Moneycontrol on Thursday, Bhargava said: “What should be the parameter (of the tests)? The one that is defined by the government or those prescribed by some private agency?”What is making Bhargava raise the question?Car-crash tests done by Global NCAP, the UK-based privately funded agency, have hogged the limelight in India over the past few months. The latest is Mahindra & Mahindra’s runaway success, Thar, which landed a four-star safety rating. With that, the top five positions in the tests have been grabbed by homegrown auto companies, M&M and Tata Motors.Global NCAP also tested one of Maruti Suzuki’s latest launches, the S-Presso, earlier in November. The micro SUV from the car market leader failed the crash tests, scoring zero stars in frontal impact. In 2019, Maruti Suzuki Ertiga and the Wagon R scored three and two stars, respectively.This invited veiled jibes from Maruti Suzuki’s competition on social media. Taking to Twitter, Tata Motors shared an image of a cart with a broken wheel with an accompanying script that read: “Safety is ‘two’ important to be ignored. Be smart before someone overturns your caRt.”The capital R in the spelling was the capital R in Wagon R while the reference to ‘two’ was the two-star rating the hatchback got in the NCAP test. Wagon R’s direct competition is the Tata Tiago, which received a four-star rating.Prior to this, Tata Motors took potshots at the S-Presso, too. “Driving is #SeriouslyFun only when you live up with safety”, Tata Motors said on Twitter along with a photo which showed a broken coffee mug and an accompanying message that read, “We don’t break that easily”. Tata Motors does not have any product in the S-Presso segment.Maruti’s responseBhargava said that it follows the crash-test norms laid down by Indian laws for every car it launches here. The frontal offset test in India is conducted at 56km/hr, whereas the Global NCAP frontal offset test is done at 64km/hr. While the testing is done by government agencies at their facilities, currently, India does not have any star-rating style on crash safety like Global NCAP.“A private company which has commercial interests of its own prescribes some (other) standards and the government prescribes some other standards. What should be followed is a question one needs to think about. Should any car company, and not just Maruti Suzuki, seek to comply with government standards or some private company standards? (Global) NCAP is a private company promoted by certain companies,” Bhargava added.Mahindra XUV300 is ranked at the top by Global NCAP, giving it a five-star rating. Besides the Mahindra Thar in fourth position, three Tata Motors cars complete the top five ranking, fully dominated by homegrown companies. Tata Altroz and Tata Nexon occupy the second and third positions with five-star ratings, followed by the Tata Tiago in the fifth position.M&M Chairman Anand Mahindra tweeted: “My 1st source of pride is that the 5 safest cars in India and Indian. My 2nd source of pride is that in the garage of Mahindra are 1) India’s safest car overall 2) India’s safest off-roader 3) India’s safest MPV (multi-purpose vehicle)”.Bhargava’s response to Tata Motors tweetsBhargava said that Maruti Suzuki is more interested in knowing what the consumer wants instead of what the competition is doing. He pointed out that Maruti’s volumes have not suffered despite the promotion done by the Global NCAP ratings done by its rivals."
Maruti Suzuki,26 Nov 2020,"Toyota Etios marks 10th anniversary next month: A look at the company’s ambition during the launch, and where it stands now","The first week of December 2020 will mark the 10th anniversary of Toyota’s first made-for-India product. Launched in December 2010, the Etios sedan was to become one of the largest-selling proucts for the Japanese giant in India.Aspirations riding on the Etios were such that Toyota targeted to grab 10 percent of the Indian car market by 2015, up from 3 percent back then. The Etios Liva, the sedan’s hatchback version, which was launched in the first half of 2011, was to add incremental volumes. Both were developed on the lines of the hugely popular Maruti Suzuki Swift Dzire and Swift.Both models were perceived to be the first serious attempt by Toyota to crack the mass market segment, which accounted for more than 85 percent of the Indian car market.Like Honda, Toyota, too, had established itself as a premium brand in India. The Camry luxury sedan was launched in 2002, Corolla, a premium sedan in 2003, followed by the Fortuner, a premium sport utility vehicle (SUV) in 2009.The Etios and Liva brought the entry price of a Toyota car to below Rs 10 lakh, a record broken only once earlier by the boxy-looking Qualis, which was priced at Rs 6 lakh and launched in 2000.Toyota stopped producing the Qualis in 2005 to make way for the Innova, which was launched in the same year.In April 2018, Toyota introduced the Yaris sedan to take on Honda City, Maruti Suzuki Ciaz and Hyundai Verna, among others. Prior to this launch, its regular models such as the Corolla (Corolla Altis), Innova (Innova Crysta), Camry (Camry Hybrid) and the Fortuner received upgrades.Following the switchover to Bharat Stage VI emission norms from April 1, 2020, Toyota decided to pull the plug on the Etios, Liva and the Corolla Altis.Cut to the presentBy the first week of next month, Toyota will find itself in the same position as it did a decade ago. Its market share by the end of November is expected to remain around 3-3.5 percent. It was 3.4 percent by the end of October as per data shared by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).The slight increase in market share was thanks to the deal between Toyota and Suzuki Motor Corporation. As per the arrangement, Suzuki agreed to manufacture and supply the Baleno and Brezza to Toyota, which were rebadged to Glanza and Urban Cruiser, respectively, before they hit showrooms.As of October, the two models accounted for nearly 50 percent of Toyota’s India sales. The balance is mainly driven by the Innova Crysta.Innova Crysta, the premium multi-seater contributes 36 percent to Toyota’s sales in India, and accounts for nearly 70 percent of the company’s output from the two plants it runs in Karnataka.Despite being one of the first multinational auto companies to enter India (1997), Toyota has struggled to get its footing right. In comparison, Kia Motors, which entered India only last year, have grabbed a 6 percent share on the back of just three products.Why is Toyota sticking around?“Toyota has its own way of developing and understanding a market, which is often a time-consuming process. The pace at which the Indian car market changed, with consumer preferences changing every four to five years, Toyota did not anticipate it and struggled to cope up. Toyota is taking its cost lessons from Suzuki, a world leader in small car technology, for the time being,” said a Mumbai-based analyst tracking the auto sector.India intends to move towards electric mobility over the next few decades. This should augur well for the Japanese giant as it has been working in the field of electric and hybrid vehicles for several years.Through the joining of hands with Suzuki, Toyota wants to roll out an affordable range of electric and hybrid vehicles in India. Though hybrid vehicles (at 28 percent) do not enjoy the same GST as electric vehicles (at 5 percent), a softening of stance by the government is expected.The Camry Hybrid, for example, is priced at Rs 40 lakh, and the Volvo XC 90 at Rs 1.35 crore, and Lexus NX at Rs 55 lakh.Workers’ strikeThe company is now seeing a workers’ strike at two plants in Bidadi, Karnataka of Toyota Kirloskar Motor. However, the company says they only play a minimal role in the company’s operations."
Maruti Suzuki,25 Nov 2020,Nearly half of Toyota’s volumes are safe from factory lockout,"Both of Toyota’s plants in India, at Bidadi, Karnataka, produce only half of whatever the company manages to sell from its dealerships. On November 24, Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) announced a lockout for the second time at both of its plants. A section of the employees had been on strike and this has affected production.Nearly half of Toyota’s volumes are safe as 50 percent of its production is outsourced to Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC), the parent company of Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL).Toyota Glanza and Toyota Urban Cruiser are manufactured at SMC’s Gujarat plant and MSIL’s Gurgaon, Haryana plant, respectively. As of October-end, both models accounted for nearly 50 percent of Toyota’s sales in India.On November 24, Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) introduced the facelifted Innova at Rs 16.26 lakh (ex-showroom). The launch came just a day after TKM Following the directions of the Government of Karnataka, the management at TKM had withdrawn the lockout, effective November 19, 2020. However, even after the withdrawal of the lockout by TKM, only few workmen reported to work as per their shift schedule while a majority of the striking workers’ union members continued with their strike.Toyota’s single-largest selling model, Innova Crsyta, which accounts for 36 percent of its India sales, continues to be produced in limited numbers as per details shared by a company official.The Yaris, Camry Hybrid and Fortuner are the other models are manufactured by Toyota in India. Vellfire, a premium multi-seater, is a fully imported model. These four models account for about 15 percent of TKM’s India sales.“We would minimise any inconvenience to our customers via vehicles at dealerships and stock at factories. Also, there is some production still happening at the plant with limited manpower,” the official said.Employee strike“For the plant operations to run smoothly and effectively, a minimum workforce of 90 percent in each shift is required, and, in view of the current situation, it is not viable to carry on with manufacturing activity with such a small number of workmen reporting for work,” said a TKM spokesperson.TKM alleged that post the withdrawal of lockout, around 400-500 union members were trying to barge into the plant’s premises forcibly every day at unscheduled hours.“Such hostile activities have created a volatile situation around the factory premises and unsafe conditions for other employees of the company,” said the spokesperson.“Moreover, a few members are also instigating the illegal strike and disrespecting other members who want to return to work or those who are already working and taking on the additional burden caused by the strike. They were also making derogatory and provocative speeches, defaming the company and its officials and threatening the officers of the company,” added the spokesperson.On November 13, TKM suspended 39 members of the union, who, it alleges, were involved in acts of misconduct. They were placed under suspension, pending enquiry. The strike was triggered by the suspension of a union member. Toyota declared the strike as illegal.Toyota’s appealToyota’s plants have the capacity to produce 310,000 units a year, but were operating at 25 percent by the end of October. As per data shared by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), TKM sales rose 4 percent in October 2020 to 12,373 units, while it fell 51 percent during April-October to 36,937 units. The fall was worse than the 26 percent fall recorded by the passenger vehicle segment during the same seven months."

Maruti Suzuki,08 Nov 2020,Automakers log dip in fleet sales in September quarter amid coronavirus pandemic,"Leading passenger vehicle manufacturers Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai Motor and Toyota Kirloskar Motor have witnessed sharp drop in fleet sales in the July-September period amid the coronavirus pandemic.The fleet segment sales have fallen during the period under review as people were opting for personal mobility options at the cost of shared and public transport in order to maintain distance in the times of the pandemic.""There has been extreme aversion on the part of customers against shared mobility and public transport and they are obviously looking at personal transport. If we look at the figures in our portfolio, fleet sales which include shared mobility, in the second quarter there was a drop of 69 percent,"" Maruti Suzuki India Executive Director (Sales and Marketing) Shashank Srivastava said.Taking into consideration the April-September period, the drop in fleet sales is 77 percent as compared with last year, he added.""As a result in our portfolio, fleet sales which stood at 7 percent last year (contribution to total sales) have fallen to 2.4 percent this year,"" Srivastava said.The auto major offers Tour range of variants across hatchback, sedan, van and MPV segments for commercial use in models like Alto, WagonR, Celerio, Eeco, TourS and Ertiga.Hyundai Motor India, which sells its compact sedan Xcent in the fleet segment, has also seen sales dwindle in the segment post COVID-19.""The demand has shifted from shared mobility to personal segment so obviously the fleet segment has been impacted. Many financiers are also finding it tough, they are not sure about the future business of this segment so they are also becoming strict so the market for the fleet segment has come down,"" Hyundai Motor India Director (Sales, Marketing and Service) Tarun Garg said.There is no impact on the overall sales as the personal segment has more than made for the loss, he added.""We continue to monitor the situation. It may be a short-term phenomena, the shared mobility segment has done so well in the global markets. It may start doing better here as well in future once the pandemic is over,"" Garg noted.The company, however, did not share absolute numbers.Similarly, Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) said it has also seen institutional sales of Innova Crysta drop during the second quarter.""The fleet segment is very badly hit. It has literally come to a standstill. People are just not willing to sit in taxis and shared cars. It is a very challenging scenario. There is a dip of 15-20 percent in the taxi segment alone as compared with the year-ago period,"" TKM Senior Vice President (Sales and Service) Naveen Soni said.The institutional sales of Innova Crysta, which include taxi, corporate and government sales altogether, have gone down by 65.72 percent to 1,386 units in the July-September quarter this year as compared with 4,044 units in the year-ago period, the company said."

Today, Maruti Suzuki also transports a significant amount of volume via rail and coastal shipping. This shift is secular and is bound to continue over the next few years. Auto companies have been working with Railways in designing of auto rakes and ensuring seamless transportation. Once the upcoming Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) comes up, the volume will increase even further as DFC allows for time-tabled rake movements,"" he told Moneycontrol.Apart from Maruti and Hyundai, other carmakers like Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors, Kia are also using the services of Railways.In a tweet posted last month, Anand Mahindra acknowledged the efforts of the Indian Railways for transporting its Bolero pick-up vans from Navi Mumbai to Benapole in Bangladesh.Railways operates two types of rakes — small rakes, which can carry 100-125 cars and big rakes, which can carry 275 to 318 cars."

Bharti Airtel,08 Dec 2020,India specific 5G standard an existential threat: Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal,"The idea to develop India specific 5G standard is an existential threat and will lock the country out of the global ecosystem, a senior Bharti Airtel official said on Tuesday.The official also said the development of a separate 5G standard will impact innovation.""There are sometimes talks that India must have its own 5G standard. This is an existential threat which could lock India out of the global ecosystem and slow down the pace of innovation. We could have let our citizens down if you allow that to happen,” Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal said while speaking at virtual India Mobile Congress 2020.The statement from Vittal followed a speech by RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani at the event, where he mentioned that Jio’s 5G network ""will be powered by indigenous-developed network, hardware and technology components”.Jio has sought spectrum in certain frequencies from the Department of Telecom for holding trials of the latest 5G technology.The company’s wholly-owned US-based subsidiary Radisys has already started selling some of the 5G solutions to foreign companies. Vittal said India should have an open ecosystem. He cited examples of CDMA and GSM to push his case.""CDMA was better technology, but GSM won because it was more accepted technology. More companies in the world embraced GSM. GSM won because it became part of the global ecosystem and CDMA died,” he added.He said that there is a need to create an India open ecosystem and promote applications developed for India and by India.""For this we have to come together. We have to set aside our differences and be part of one. Telcos, equipment players, device players, manufacturing companies, IT companies. Everyone can benefit as the globe of technology makes it all more productive,” Vittal said.He called for enabling a policy environment that keeps access to affordable technology.""…If we as a country can embrace global standards, create an open ecosystem for India and leverage this to reimagine our businesses by having a single and predictable policy environment, the entrepreneurial energy of India will develop digital India,” Vittal said.He had earlier said that the company will refrain from bidding for 5G spectrum if the reserve price is high.Regulator Trai has recommended a price of Rs 492 crore per Mhz for spectrum in the 3,300-3,600 Mhz band which is considered suitable for 5G services at present.Telecom operators interested in buying radiowaves for 5G services will have to shell out a minimum of Rs 9,840 crore on pan-India basis to buy spectrum in the 3,300-3,600 Mhz band as Trai has suggested that it should be put to auction in the block size of 20 MHz.Earlier also, Airtel had said that it will not bid for this spectrum at the Trai-recommended price as companies will need to shell out about Rs 50,000 crore to acquire a decent quantity of frequencies in this band."

Bandhan is already present in North & East so may easily capitalise on UP opportunity. High-quality low-cost deposit franchisee of PSU in Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam, West Bengal and UP can easily migrate to nimble and efficient private banks like Bandhan. There is also a strong housing opportunity for Bandhan Bank which it will capitalize through GRUH merger. Cost income Ratio is low and Asset quality of the company is maintained.ICICI Lombard General InsuranceThe 0.97 percent penetration of non-life insurance industry in India as a percentage of GDP gives us a clear picture of the kind of growth Insurance as a sector will have going forward. The company offers various insurances covering travel, home, health and motor segments. The company has strong brand equity, extensive distribution reach, strong digital capabilities and a comprehensive product portfolio. About 96.5 percent of the policies issued by the company are in paperless form now. On the health insurance front, the company has introduced an AI-enabled claim settlement engine to authorise some of the health claims.During the lockdown months of April and May, 31 percent of all the health cashless claims were authorised using this tool. The company is increasing sales infrastructure/manpower to increase penetration in Tier 3 & 4 cities and hence may see an increase in headcount in the medium term. Renewals in the motor insurance during the lockdown were reasonably strong and the trend is encouraging with private cars increasing in the mix for the company. The general insurance space looks attractive with strong growth potential.Bharti AirtelBharti Airtel is a leading global telecommunications company with operations in 16 countries across Asia and Africa. Indian telecom ARPU is at an unsustainable lower level. Low data cost per GB in India 9 cents, lowest in world versus average $5 globally. India’s digital payment space is expected to grow the segment by about five-fold to $1 trillion by 2023. The exponential increase in data usage will lead to higher ARPU. The company has been able to successfully turnaround the Africa Business. We see huge headroom for growth in Africa too. The company currently trades at the lower end of EV/ EBIDTA valuation range of 8-15.Expert: Jyoti Roy, DVP-Equity Strategist at Angel BrokingCholamandalam InvestmentCholamandalam Investment has one of the most diversified AUMs in terms of product mix and geographical presence. The company has posted a very good set of number for Q2FY21 and has given AUM growth guidance of 12-15 percent for FY21 while asset quality has also improved. A diversified product mix will help capture growth in the LCV, tractor, and 2-wheeler segment. Adequate capital adequacy, declining cost of funds and strong parentage provide comfort. The company will benefit significantly from stabilization in the operating environment.Galaxy SurfactantsThe company has been increasing its share of high margin specialty care products in its portfolio which now accounts for around 40 percent of its revenues while the balance is accounted for by the performance surfactant business. The company has a very strong relationship with MNC clients and supplies raw materials to them not only in India but also in US, EU and MENA region. Though the company's operations had been impacted due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Q1FY21, we expect revenues to bounce back strongly in Q2FY21 given the company's exposure to the personal and home care segment and recovery in the specialty segment.Metropolis HealthcareCompany has an asset light model with a strong Balance sheet having cash and cash equivalents to the tune of Rs 235 crore as on June 30, 2020. From 62.6 percent revenue de-growth (including covid testing) YoY in April 2020, the company has registered 40 percent revenue growth in September 2020 as COVID revenue is an additional source of revenue for the company. Non-COVID business is almost back to the normal. We are positive on the long term prospects of the company given expected long term growth rates of around 15 percent CAGR, stable margins profile and moderating competitive intensity.Expert: Ajit Mishra, VP Research at Religare BrokingICICI BankThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the banking sector as a whole however measures lend by RBI and government help it to pass through this difficult time. At present in Q2FY21, we witnessed many banking players (both private and public banks) posted better numbers on the back of improving asset quality, better collections and lower provision.In the coming quarters, with improving demand and the economy getting back on track, the banking sector would see good growth recovery. We would prefer investing in large private banking space with ICICI bank as our preferred pick. The bank has a strong brand name, high focus on the retail portfolio, healthy capital and liquidity position, stable asset quality, a large customer base and improved corporate governance under new management. We remain optimistic about its long-term growth.Bharti AirtelBharti Airtel is well placed to benefit from increased traction received in digital services which we believe is likely to continue going forward. After a steady addition of customers, Bharti can continue to gain market share in the mobile services business. The uncertainty over AGR dues is also behind us as Supreme Court has allowed 10 years payment window for telecom operators. In our view, the tariff hike would continue from here on, to reduce the financial stress on telecom companies which would benefit Bharti Airtel due to its strong customer base and a healthy addition of 4G customers. Further, strong cash flow generation would also help in deleveraging the balance sheet.Kansai Nerolac PaintsIndian paint sector is expected to grow in double-digit driven by government initiatives for housing, rising disposable income, increase in rural spending, and reduction in repainting cycle and pickup in auto demand. In the near term, due to COVID as well as the slowdown in Auto, KNPL performance is expected to be muted in FY21 as it is a market leader in industrial paint segment. Nonetheless, going forward, the company has plans to grow in both decorative as well as industrial space and gain market share driven by innovative products, focus on non-auto segments, increase distribution network and expand in newer areas that are technology-intensive. Further, support from parent as well as technical collaboration with other global players augurs well for the growth. Moreover, its recent foray into adhesives and construction chemicals segment would aid benefits in the coming quarters. Besides, benign raw material prices would as well help for the expansion of margin for the company.Expert: S Ranganathan, Heaf of Research at LKP SecuritiesAction Construction EquipmentAction Construction Equipment is a classic smallcap to play the opening up theme of the economy across sectors including the agriculture sector. Given its strong balance sheet and promoter holding we believe that ACE is a proxy play across construction, material handling & tractors.RaymondRaymond with a solid brand equity in apparels is also a major player in textiles & garmenting. The stock being a victim of the pandemic offers value across its various verticals since the cost optimisation and operating efficiencies are now visible in their first half numbers. De-Merger should in our view enhance shareholder value by next Samvat.Polycab IndiaPolycab is undergoing a transformation from being a B2B entity to a B2C entity with its fast moving electrical branded products growing at a scorching pace. We believe that given its brand equity, Polycab is in a sweet spot and can emerge much stronger next fiscal.Expert: Prashanth Tapse, AVP Research at Mehta EquitiesTata MotorsWe have seen remarkable comeback in the auto stocks of late in last 2 months and we believe Tata Motors has a lot of potential to perform. It has remained a high beta stock because of lot of news flow from JLR Europe, China market and Brexit uncertainty, but now, tables have turned and improvement is being witnessed in both JLR and Tata Motors domestic business. If investors are looking for a multibagger, Tata Motors could be a strong candidate from current levels. Hence we recommend investors to accumulate in range Rs 130-140 levels.HDFC Life Insurance CompanyInvestor looking for a high quality business with consistent earnings growth, this stock offers the best in class investment opportunity to accumulate at the current levels in the range of Rs 570-600. We believe insurance space is the next rising sector, driven by structural factors such pick-up in the economy, increasing share of insurance products within financial assets, increasing working population and growing urbanisation will be key to the growth of insurance sector. Considering optimal scale of operations, efficient use of distribution channels (bank support), healthy persistency ratios and higher new business mix from protection business drives future growth.We see opportunity for insurance industry amid COVID-19. We believe people would start realizing the importance of insurance and the backing it provides in the trying times like the current ones. Even though there has been a slowdown in the last 2 months in terms of adding new policies, we still believe HDFC Life is optimistic on protection growth and as soon as things get normalised in near future people will look for brand and take up policy for life. HDFC Life continued to be the market leaders in terms of total new business received premium with a leading market share in the private sector compared to others. Hence we believe the stock to deliver steady returns over the medium term. On valuation per se, it is trading in premium valuations to its listed peers while we expect this to sustain and the stock to deliver steady returns over the medium term to long term.Expert: Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global ResearchHDFC Life Insurance CompanyThe stock is leading private life insurance company with robust operating margin margins, stock has potential to show good numbers in coming quarters too.Adani Ports and Special Economic ZoneAdani Ports received good addition of orders in its order book.

Bharti Airtel,19 Oct 2020,Buy Bharti Airtel; target of Rs 605: Dolat Capital Market,"Dolat Capital Market's research report on Bharti AirtelBharti’s share price has declined sharply (~30%) since the AGR verdict on 1st Sep, 2020. We believe this is on account of news flow of fund-raise by VIL, Jio postpaid plus plan launch and most importantly lack of good news on tariff increase. This is in contrast to expectations of immediate announcement of price hike post the AGR case closure. Our calculation implies that from an ARPU growth, market is now implying a de-growth. However, we still maintain that 15-20% ARPU CAGR is likely and essential for survival of industry.OutlookWe reiterate BUY on Bharti with TP of Rs 605 @ 10/7x Sep22E EV/EBITDA for India Wireless / Africa.

Bharti Airtel,01 Oct 2020,Quant Pick - Bharti Airtel: ICICI Direct,"ICICI Direct's research report on Bharti AirtelDerivatives & Quantitative OutlookIn the past three months, Bharti Airtel has underperformed the Nifty by falling 30%, compared to 9% upside in the Nifty. The fall in Bharti Airtel was due to negative news flows. Reduced weightage in MSCI and FTSE also added pressure and has dragged the stock lower. Recently, the Nifty witnessed long liquidation. Due to that, the October series of Nifty open interest (OI) is one of the lowest seen in the last 10 years. At the same time, most of the stock futures have started the October series with significantly low open interest. In contrast, the OI in Bharti has remained prominent while the current OI in the stock is the highest seen in the last 10 year. We believe the recent short positions in the stock are still intact. This is expected to get covered near the support zone of Rs 400-420 levels.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

TCS,26 Nov 2020,FC Kohli no more: Father of Indian IT industry had ‘a tough-love’ management style that pushed barriers,"Ask those who knew him well and they would remember Faqir Chand Kohli, the first Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), as the father of the Indian IT industry.Kohli, who last spoke to Moneycontrol in October, passed away on November 26 of natural causes. He is survived by his wife and three children.""Mr. Faqir Kohli formed and led TCS from its founding days. He guided the company in its early years and defined the vision for its growth,"" said Tata group patriarch and Chairman Emeritus Ratan N Tata.""His early vision played an important role in creating the outstandingly successful global IT company that TCS has become today,"" Tata added.Tata also said: ""Kohli's contribution in various technology-oriented areas was significant. and he will be remembered as one of the fathers of India’s successful IT industry.""He was gracious, unassuming, and always willing to help, Tata noted.Other senior Tata leaders echo those views. “Kohli was a brilliant technocrat and a business leader with varied interests. He was passionate about the development of our nation and its youth,” said former CEO and Vice Chairman of TCS S Ramadorai, who took over after Kohli retired.Kohli, who was 96 years old, ran TCS more like a promoter, which was to mean that it was his own company and that he never allowed resources to be wasted just because it could be put on the corporate balance sheet, said management consultant Hiru Bijlani, who was a long-time friend of the Kohlis.“He made very sure he ran a tight ship,”  Bijlani said, adding that Kohli had a “tough-love” management style and pushed through more barriers for Indian IT than people are aware of.That’s something that even Ramadorai recalls experiencing. “He always challenged me by presenting me with different situations and new opportunities in our early days. This was something I learned from him and imbibed as I grew to build my teams at TCS later,” Ramadorai said.“I will forever cherish the opportunity to have worked with a stalwart like him,” he added.Kohli was roped in from the Tata Electric Companies, and was instrumental in the decision to bring IBM to India as part of Tata-IBM in 1991. His role in setting up TCS and running it later is well documented.He became the director of the company in 1970 and was appointed as the first CEO of TCS later. He retired in 1999 at the age of 75 by which time the profits of TCS were as much as if not more than most of the other group companies, Bijlani said.Kohli, who had a green thumb and spent time in his garden in Alibaugh, was also a frequent golfer. He shot to an 18-handicap and hit a long ball even at the age of 80, and applied the same approach to work. “His work continued well after he retired, with pursuits that included educating the less fortunate through word recognition programmes and by pushing for more recognition for engineering programmes and the industry in India,” Bijlani said.In his free time, Kohli would continue to read up on the latest developments in technology and engineering and admitted in earlier interviews that most of it was “very technical”.Both the career highs that he cherished had to do with recognition from professional bodies. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, or IEEE, which was a professional association for electronic engineering and electrical engineering with its corporate office in New York City, honoured Kohli with a fellowship, making him at the time the only non-American in the world to get it.The other accomplishment he regarded highly was becoming a member and fellow of the South East Asia Computer Society and was the only non-Singaporean to get it.Voltas's former Managing Director Nawshir Khurody, who knew him in his early career, said: ""Whenever I reached him for help as a young TAS officer, Kohli would set aside everything and reach out to help him. His passing has brought back memories of how few people like him are left in the Tata group. He was a humble genius and a very remarkable man.”Khurody remembered how at the breakfast table in Pune at the Tata Management Training Centre, Kohli took the toast rack at breakfast, handed it to him, and said ""here you need it more than me"".Kohli  never cared what car he drove or what he wore or about the trappings of leadership and power. ""At the training centre, he would ask the most junior people the names of the trees and was never afraid to learn from them,"" Khurody recalled, adding that two things Kohli would tell everyone were: All software and computer work should be done in Indian languages and that India cannot become a super power until IT is extensively deployed across the country.""We will always be reminded of the huge contribution Mr Kohli made to the Tata group. It is his vision, passion, discipline and commitment that set the culture in TCS. The grounded yet dynamic culture in TCS is a reflection of his strength of character, and I believe is what sets it apart from most of its competitors, said Cyrus Mistry, former Chairman of Tata group.""His vision not only gave birth to TCS, but established the whole software industry in India, it is this tremendous contribution that earned him the coveted Padma Bhushan so richly deserved by him,"" he added.A social tippler who would enjoy his single malt whiskey responsibly, Kohli was known to be direct and even ribbing friends on their dress-sense when they wore shirts that looked like table cloths.At his home in the Air India Building at Nariman Point, guests were welcomed to warm hospitable entertainment with either jazz music or ghazals playing in the background.Because TCS’ first office was opposite the Air India Building, where he lived, the joke was that he walked across the road and built the TCS building. Later he went there to work out of his office right until the end before the lockdown came into effect in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.“During my interactions with him, I had become a firm believer that most people rise to new challenges,” Ramadorai observed. “He was also my mentor, guide and a very close family friend, and his demise is a personal loss to our family.”At his farewell, the Tata group organised a going away bash at the Taj Hotel in Colaba and had celebrated Indian flautist Hariprasad Chaurasia perform at the function which was attended by the top brass at the group.“The nation has lost a true visionary and legend today,” Ramadorai said."

However, the trend seems to be positive although a healthy correction could be expected.Q) Which are the important levels that investors should track in the coming week or in the run-up to Diwali?A) The Nifty closed above its psychological level of the 12,000 mark, which is an important level to look for next week.For the coming week, the Nifty might touch its all-time high of 12,430.50 led by private banks and technology stocks. India VIX closed near 20, shows that bulls might continue to hold the grip. However, investors should chase quality stock in the coming week.Q) On the broader markets front, both Small & Midcap underperformed benchmark indices in the week gone by. Looks like investors are staying with large-cap names in the run-up to US elections as well as Diwali? What are your views?A) In my opinion, Largecaps might continue to outperform broader indices. Investors are likely to stay with largecap amidst a volatile week.Strong earnings in Q2FY21 along with firm global cues might continue to push Nifty to a higher level in the coming week. However, a rally might catch-up in broader indices too, which might trigger buying momentum in mid and small caps. But, largecap might provide a cushion over broader indices.Q) Any 3-5 trading ideas for the next 3-4 weeks?A) Here is a list of top trading ideas for the next 3-4 weeks:Tata Consultancy Services Limited: Buy | Trigger Price: Rs 2720 | Target: Rs 2860 | Stop Loss: Rs 2665 | Upside: 5%The stock has witnessed a reversal from its support level.

Operating profit increased 17.6% to Rs 883.6 crore. Operating margins improved 158 bps to 24.9%. The expansion in margins was a result of 54 bps gross margins expansion & 175 bps saving in overhead spends (largely due to lower advertisement spends). Net profit was down 1.4% to Rs 587.1 crore mainly due to lower tax in the base quarter due to changes in the corporate tax rate last year.OutlookIn CY20, the company announced a dividend of Rs 196 /share, which is ~88% dividend payout.

We believe supply in April was normal only for milk products & all other categories witnessed resumption of manufacturing in slow & gradual manner. The quarter witnessed a strong growth in ‘Everyday’, ‘Nestlé a+’ & ‘Milkmaid’ mainly due to very high sales in initial weeks of April. We believe the company anticipated large scale disruption in milk supply or shift in consumer demand from pouch to powder & UHT Milk. However, pouch milk supply disruption did not last longer than few weeks, resulting in piling up of ‘Everyday’ inventory at the end of distributors. We believe milk products would see inventory rationalisation at the distributor level given demand conditions from hotels, restaurants & airline remain muted. Operating profit saw growth of 7.2% with margins expanding 127 bps. The margin expansion was led by cost cutting measures & reduction in A&P spend (overhead spends down 487 bps) partially offset by the 193 bps contraction in gross margins.

Asian Paints,25 Oct 2020,Buy Asian Paints; target of Rs 2440: ICICI Direct,"ICICI Direct's research report on Asian PaintsAsian Paints reported stellar numbers with one of the best quarterly EBITDA margins in Q2FY21. The EBITDA margin at 23.6%, up ~470 bps YoY led by benign raw material prices and saving in other expenditure in Q2FY21. On the revenue front, sales growth at ~6% YoY was led by double digit (I-direct estimate: ~10%) volume growth in Q2FY21. Despite being a lean season on account of monsoons, the strong decorative volume growth is attributable to significant pent up demand in rural and semi urban regions led by repainting/maintenance activities. Gradual opening up of metro regions along with inventory build-up in the wake of festive seasons at dealer would have also help drive the volume growth in Q2FY21. We believe normalisation in metro regions, revival in the real estate industry and intact repainting demand from semi-urban, rural India would drive paint demand, going forward. Besides, we believe favourable raw material prices are likely to keep gross margins elevated in the coming quarters even with a change in product mix. This, coupled with rationalisation of other costs would help drive EBITDA margin, going forward. We revise our revenue, earnings estimates upside by 6% and 33%, respectively, for FY21E factoring in the current quarter performance.

According to the management while tier II, tier III cities saw a strong demand recovery in Q1FY21, demand recovery in metros, tier 1 cities (contribute ~40-50% in sales) was slower due to intermediary lockdowns especially in western regions.

Despite various headwinds, Titan continued on its store addition spree by opening 14 Tanishq stores in H1FY21 (eight stores added in Q2FY21). The liquidity stress faced by regional unorganised players can play out as an opportunity for Titan. Titan’s healthy balance sheet will enable it to capture market share growth opportunities through healthy store additions.

Increased demand from the wedding segment, higher demand for Gold Harvest Scheme, and improved sales of gold, considering it as the safest bet of investment, will enhance performance in the coming quarters. Other businesses such as watches and eyewear will take some time for recovery as out-of-home consumption is on backseat in the near term. Overall, management expects full recovery by Q4FY2021 (jewellery business might see full recovery from Q3FY2021).

HUL,21 Nov 2020,Unilever says its mouthwash will reduce 99.9% coronavirus after rinsing,"Global FMCG major Unilever on November 21 said it will bring to India its mouthwash formulation, which, it claims, will reduce 99.9 percent of coronavirus after 30 seconds of rinsing.""Unilever has confirmed that preliminary lab test results show that mouthwash formulation containing CPC Technology reduces 99.9 per cent of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, after 30 seconds of rinsing,"" the company said in a statement.The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose, which has been detected before, during, and after the acute phase of illness, as well as in asymptomatic cases.""Therefore, reducing the viral load in the mouth could help to reduce transmission. The findings indicate that mouthwash could become an important addition to other everyday protective measures like handwashing, physical distancing and mask wearing,"" it added.Also read: Two companies say their COVID-19 vaccines are 95% effective. What does that mean?COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Unilever Oral Care Research and Development Head Glyn Roberts said, ""While we are clear that this is not a cure or proven way to prevent the transmission of coronavirus, our results are promising.""Roberts added that given the critical stage of the pandemic, the company feels it is important to share the results of the mouthwash.This technology will be brought to India by Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), Unilever's arm, in Pepsodent Germicheck Mouth Rinse Liquid, which will be launched in India in December 2020, the company said.Unilever said the test for its mouthwash containing CPC (cetylpyridinium chloride) technology was conducted by an independent and internationally accredited testing facility, Microbac Laboratories, on behalf of Unilever Research Laboratories in the US.CPC is a widely used cosmetic ingredient, also used by the dental industry, and is known for its antibacterial and anti-virus benefits.The test focussed on both 30 and 60 seconds rinse times, aiming to replicate the real-life use of mouthwash in an in-vitro context."

Foods segment saw strong 19% growth supported by price hike in tea segment. Home care segment declined 1.6% with 2.3% price cuts in fabric wash. The recovery in the business was led by complete normalisation of supply chain & strong demand in health, hygiene & nutrition space. However, demand for discretionary & out of home products has still remained dismal. The health, hygiene & nutrition products that constitute 80% of sales witnessed growth of 10% whereas discretionary & out of home consumption products, which constitute 20%of sales saw a decline of 25%. Gross margin declined 145 bps largely on account of a sharp 70% increase in tea prices. Though the company has taken price hikes, it is not sufficient to pass on the entire cost increase. With 221 bps lower advertisement spends, HUL was able to maintain its operating margins at 25.1% (27 bps up). Net profit increased 8.7% to Rs 2009 crore. The slower growth in profitability is largely due to lower tax in base quarter.OutlookWe believe H2FY21E would witness strong growth across segments with complete demand recovery in discretionary portfolio as well. The company has been able to leverage strong brands in hygiene (Lifebuoy, Domex, Vim, Surf Excel) space to drive growth.

The company is seeing (a) ad-spends inching up (-5% YoY; ahead of expectations), (b) sharp increase in palm oil costs, and (c) mix deterioration. Thus, HUVR did well in growing its EBITDA margins (including GSKCH) by 30bp YoY and restricting like-for-like margin decline to only 60bp YoY. Margin outlook for HUVR has also improved as share of its discretionary portfolio to total sales should increase sequentially. Outlook for the company is gradually improving.

HUL,21 Oct 2020,Buy Hindustan Unilever; target of Rs 2502: Prabhudas Lilladher,"Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan UnileverWe are upgrading HUL to Buy given strong growth and margin outlook, high FCF conversion (5-year average of >90%), 95% dividend payout and 18.2% PAT CAGR over FY1-23. HUVR results beat expectations driven by double digit growth in Health, Nutrition and Hygiene and better than expected recovery in Personal care. HUL remains confident of gaining market share across categories and has cut prices of Detergents and absorbed part of input cost increase in Tea. Although color cosmetics and Deo’s will see a delayed recovery, lack of inventory push will enable strong 3Q relative to last year. GSK integration is in progress and any meaningful gains in sales growth will accrue from 4Q only. Near term margin outlook remains challenging given higher prices of Palmoil and Tea and bottomed out ad- spends.

However, Specialty pharma is a vastly different business model compared to traditional generics requiring significantly superior R&D skills, M&A capabilities, business development strategy and risk appetite. Having built a branded portfolio focused on dermatology and ophthalmology, Sun is ahead of Indian peers in building a specialty business in the US. Ramp-up of Ilumya, Cequa, Yonsa, Xelpros, Bromsite and Odomzo sales are value drivers for SUNP’s specialty business in the next 3-4 years.OutlookWe value the company on an SOTP basis and assign India formulation 18x EV/EBIDTA, 12x EV/EBITDA to RoW/EM and 7x EV/EBITDA for US formulations.

These trends are common across companies. On the other hand, SUNP’s US sales fell 25% qoq − the sharpest so far among covered names. The US business was largely impacted by a 38% qoq decline in specialty portfolio (at US$78mn) and 33% in Taro (63% of portfolio is derma, which is one of the severely hit segments). SUNP’s own generic business was flat qoq. India growth of +3% yoy beat our estimate of a 3% decline (chronic skew aided). Opex cut in Q1 is unlikely to sustain as marketing activity picks up from Q2 onward. With a slow ramp-up in the specialty portfolio, we expect limited margin expansion in the interim due to generic competition in Absorica (Dec’20), increase in India field force (by around 10%) and increase in R&D spends. We expect flat margins over FY20-22E.OutlookWe raise FY22/23E EPS by 5% each and increase the TP to Rs542 as we roll over to 23x June’22E EPS (vs. 20x earlier). Higher multiple is on account of the reducing overhang of DOJ penalty with the recent settlement.

UltraTechCement,03 Nov 2020,Is the post COVID recovery a blip?,"- Significant improvement in collection efficiency of banks points to broad-based normalization of activitiesIn the run-up to the Q2 FY21 earning season, we had expected the beneficiaries of the new normal like the technology and telecom sectors to post a strong show and almost every other company to report a huge sequential improvement as the April-June quarter was a washout for most businesses impacted by the lockdown.The early trends from Q2 were more or less on expected lines with most large technology companies surpassing our optimistic assumptions, thanks to a significant acceleration in investment by enterprises on technology in the areas of cloud and digital with operational efficiencies and cost reduction propelling margins.The surprise winnerWe were pleasantly surprised when besides the usual suspects, purely domestic demand driven cement companies surprised the Street positively. Contrary to expectations of no growth, the three leading pan India players - UltraTech, ACC and Ambuja - reported YoY (year-on-year) volume growth and their adept management of cost resulted in enviable margins. Housing-led demand reportedly made a strong comeback while infrastructure activities were showing early signs of a pick-up.Is the consumption mojo back?If this was somewhat of an aberration, the entire consumption pack virtually left no doubts that this recovery cannot be just brushed aside as pent-up demand from the June quarter. Staples, that was already in a secured spot amid the lockdown, strengthened its position with genuine demand revival. Many frontline players like Britannia, Colgate and Marico reported strong YoY volume growth. Not only staples, discretionary categories had a genuine revival story to share as well.Titan, the true blue discretionary consumption play, saw a near normal September with the flagship jewellery segment returning to near pre-COVID levels. The same positive vibes came from the earnings report of Asian Paints that witnessed YoY double digit growth in decorative paints volume.Quasi discretionary categories like electricals – fans, lighting, fast moving electrical goods - also threw a positive surprise as seen from the numbers of Havells, Crompton Consumers and Polycab with YoY growth on the back of demand coming from the retail segment although institutional business was still weak.After a quarter of austerity, consumers said cheers in Q2 as RadicoKhaitan saw a YoY growth in its volumes.Are we back to the pre-COVID days? Not entirely. While there is no permanent destruction in demand as is evident from the report card of consumption companies, the economy is still far from firing. Check this: Hindustan Unilever, again a bellwether consumption company, saw its FMCG category grow but premium discretionary items saw a huge decline resulting in overall tepid growth in volumes. Even for Asian Paints, the growth was led by the economy category with premium taking a back seat. So while consumers are out of the phase of fear, they are yet not optimistic enough to splurge.The post-COVID commutersCOVID has unleashed a change in consumer behaviour at all levels and not just in the use of e-commerce as a preferred mode of shopping. The concern over avoiding crowds has resulted in a strong surge in demand for two-wheelers, the cheapest mode of personal mobility as well as passenger cars. This is reflected in the positive YoY volume growth of Bajaj Auto, Hero, Maruti and also a stellar show of Tata Motor’s passenger vehicle business. However, cautious commuters are shunning public transport. That explains the decline in three wheeler sales in recent times. We expect a positive rub off on the ancillary segment from the automotive revival.Needless to mention, the very good monsoons, encouraging kharif sowing, rural-specific fiscal sops and record water levels have all added to the positive sentiment especially in the rural areas.Will investment follow suit?Will the positivity in consumption reflect in the companies riding on the capital expenditure (investment demand) theme – not entirely, but the early signs are heartening, nevertheless.Steel companies like JSW that managed to keep its head above water in Q1 with exports, saw strong traction from domestic market in Q2 with volumes growing YoY. Similar strength was seen in the demand for zinc as well.Pure play investment themes are not yet out of the woods, however. Larsen & Toubro’s flagship EPC business continued to report a YoY decline, although a much improved show compared to Q1 and the company dispelled concerns about labour availability impacting execution.Industrial activity is gradually picking up as Cummins India, a company that has its pulse on industrial revival is seeing early traction from diverse areas. Consumer facing manufacturers like Dixon are witnessing strong demand traction, suggestive of demand returning to pre-COVID levels in several pockets.However, a full blown revival in investment may not be on the horizon yet.Are the lenders sensing a return to normalcy?A discussion on revival is incomplete without a key constituent – the lenders, who undoubtedly have their ears on the ground. While the moratorium, followed by the Supreme Court’s order on non-classification of NPAs, has largely masked the reported NPA picture, the commentary from banks is insightful. Most large banks like HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank or IndusInd Bank have seen collection efficiency steadily improving with September figures upwards of 95 percent barring a few minuscule troubled pockets. Even large NBFCs having significant coverage like M&M Finance or Shriram are witnessing similar collection efficiency, a clear indication that the pain so far is much less than was initially feared."

UltraTechCement,22 Oct 2020,Buy UltraTech Cement: target of Rs 5350: ICICI Direct,"ICICI Direct's research report on UltraTech CementCement demand improved and remained buoyant in Q2FY21 as well, mainly contributed by rural segment. North, east and central regions showed a healthy pick-up throughout the quarter whereas demand in south and Maharashtra region saw a late recovery. The company ended Q1FY21 with 69% capacity utilisation. Of the total sales volume, retail sales contribution improved to 71% vs 66% last year. However, it came down from 78% in Q1FY21 due to pick-up in demand from infra segment. On the cost front, the company reduced fixed overheads by 14% YoY during the quarter and achieved cost savings of Rs 450 crore in H1FY21 itself against targeted annual savings of ~Rs 500 crore. Further, with the help of low cost petcoke inventory ($71/t) and reduction in other costs, total cost of production (CoP) came down by 7.4% YoY to Rs 3887/t (flat QoQ). Thus EBITDA/t improved sharply by 30% YoY to Rs 1329/t. In terms of acquired assets, Nathdwara unit operated at 60% utilisation with EBITDA of Rs 1500/t whereas Century assets operated at 68% with an EBITDA of Rs 700/t. The plants at present are running at over 80% utilisation on companywide capacity, which clearly indicates strong demand momentum to in Q3FY21 as well. While the rise in petcoke and diesel prices possess risk to further margin expansion, the various efficiency measures initiated by company would continue provide cushion against risk of sharp increase in the CoP, going forward.OutlookUltraTech has showed its capability to successfully integrate the acquired assets and protect its B/S in tough time as well.

Tech Mahindra,06 Oct 2020,Gladiator Stocks - Tech Mahindra: ICICI Direct,"ICICI Direct's research report on Tech MahindraStrategyBuy Tech Mahindra in the range of Rs 830.00–850.00 for target price of Rs 950.00 with a stop loss of Rs 780.00. Time Frame: Six months.Technical ViewThe IT sector remain in secular up trend since bottoming out in March 2020. As the major IT companies as trading at their all-time highs and are forming higher peak and higher trough in all time frame. The share price of Tech Mahindra is currently placed at the previous multiple high since February 2019 around Rs 840-850 levels. We expect the stock to resolve above the same and extend the current up move. Our expectation of resolving above the major hurdle of Rs 840-850 is based on the following key observations:a) the entire consolidation of the last eight months has taken the shape of a bullish rounding formation signalling a reversal of the corrective trend and resumption of fresh up move.b) it has witnessed a faster retracement as it has completely retraced its previous four quarter decline (Rs 846-471) in just two quarters.c) the last quarter up move is backed by strong volume of highest since CY 2009 highlighting larger participation.Hence, we expect the stock to continue with its positive momentum and head towards Rs 950 levels in the coming months as it is the 123.6% external retracement of the entire CY’20 decline (Rs 846-471).Fundamental ViewTech Mahindra is an IT service company catering to various segments like communication (~40%), manufacturing (~17%), technology, media & entertainment (~9%), Banking Financial, Services & insurance (~16%), retail transport & logistics (~7.3%) and others (11.2%). Geographically, the company generates ~49% revenues from Americas, 26% from Europe and 25% from rest of the world. The company is aiming to improve revenues and reaching industry leading growth by focusing on cross sell opportunities. The company is also increasing its. resource allocation to high growth geographies and reducing its focus on emerging & low growth geographies. Apart from improving revenues, the company is also rationalising cost to improve margins. The company aims to improve margins by improving margins of portfolio companies, lowering of discretionary spend, lower facility cost, lower travel cost, increased automation in some of the service lines, higher offshoring and benefits of large deal won in previous quarter. We believe ramp up of large deal won in previous quarters and improvement in deal wins in coming quarters will drive revenues. Further, in the long term, we believe its leadership in communication vertical will make it a key beneficiary of vendor consolidation in the segment. It would also benefit from 5G opportunities. Enterprise segment will also benefit from improved digital traction, success in large deals.

PMAG is listed in Vienna, Zurich and Frankfurt exchanges."

Bajaj Auto,30 Nov 2020,"Exclusive: Bajaj, KTM parent firm restart talks on stake transfer","Bajaj Auto and partner KTM have restarted talks on transferring the 48 percent stake held by the Indian company in the Austrian bike maker back to its holding entity.Bajaj Auto’s 48 percent equity, along with the 51.7 percent stake held by Pierer Mobility AG, make up the shareholding of KTM AG, the legal entity that is responsible for making products under its own brand, Husqvarna and GasGas brands.KTM Group and Bajaj Auto are holding discussions to transfer the 48 percent stake of Bajaj Auto in KTM AG to the listed company Pierer Mobility AG. The discussions are being held between Bajaj Auto International Holding BV, the Netherlands-based subsidiary, and Pierer Industrie AG, the parent company of Pierer Mobility AG.Although finer details of the proposed realignment of the partnership has not been shared by either companies, sources say that this would kick-start a new chapter in the 13-year-old partnership that has so far seen joint design and development of products, common use of manufacturing facility, overseas distribution pact and joint marketing and sales.The two companies had held the same discussions in March 2019, with the transaction decision targeted to be made in the second quarter of the same year. But less than three months later, both companies aborted the plan for unspecified reasons.“Pierer Mobility AG was informed by Pierer Industrie AG and Bajaj that they have restarted discussions on assessing the possibility of transferring Bajaj's 48 percent stake in KTM AG to Pierer Mobility AG, with the Pierer Group continuing to retain the controlling majority over Pierer Mobility AG”, a statement from Pierer Mobility AG said.What is different this time is the proposal to make PTW Holding AG, a newly formed entity by KTM, the 60-percent stake holder in Pierer Mobility AG. This translates to transferring the said 60 percent stake from Pierer Industrie AG to PTW Holding.“Pierer Industrie AG and Bajaj will now evaluate the proposal in detail,” the statement further added.The authorised capital enables a capital increase of up to 50 percent of the existing share capital. After the transaction, the stake of Pierer Mobility AG in KTM AG will increase from the current 51.7 percent to approximately 99.7 percent, the statement added.KTM increases 2020 forecastThe announcement of restarting discussions of stake transfer comes less than two months after the Austrian bike maker increased the forecast for the second half of 2020, following sustained high demand for all brands including e-bikes.The management board of Pierer Mobility AG decided to increase the sales forecast published at the end of August 2020 for the second half of 2020 to over € 850 million (previously € 800 million). Around 64 percent of KTM’s revenues come from Europe, followed by North America, and Mexico with 17 percent.Riding on BajajThe partnership with Bajaj Auto made the Austrian company the world's biggest premium bike manufacturer, beating US heavyweight Harley-Davidson (in volumes) in 2018 and 2019.Of the 90,331 motorcycles sold in the first half of 2020, 22 percent was manufactured and sold by Bajaj Auto in India and Indonesia. In return, Bajaj has benefited from technology sharing and becoming the sole manufacturer of KTM and Husqvarna bikes outside of Europe, with exports reaching the US, Japan and South Asia.From worldwide volumes of 280,099 units clocked in 2019, KTM is expecting to sell around 400,000 two-wheelers in 2022. This will include nearly doubling of production at Bajaj Auto’s Chakan, Pune-based plant to 200,000 units, from around 108,000 units at present. This will include a mix of joint products (of KTM and Husqvarna bands) and KTM products distributed by Bajaj on a licence fee model.The two companies have also started work on electric two-wheelers. The first of such e-bikes having power range between 3 and 10 kW (48 volts) will roll off the Chakan production line. The platform will support various product variants under the brand of both the partners.KTM is developing a 4kW electric scooter under the Husqvarna brand whose market launch is expected to take place in 2021. This will be followed by the launch of Husqvarna E-Pilen, a 4kW/10kW, fully electric motorcycle with modular battery system. The Husqvarna E-Pilen is expected to be launch-ready in 2022."
